345,Portugal,"This is a rich, full-bodied wine that is ready to drink now. It still has a dry core of tannins, although they are overwhelmed by the rich, juicy black fruits and generous texture. It's a concentrated wine, high in alcohol, although that is really balanced by the fresh aftertaste.",Terra d'Alter,91,14,Alentejano,Aragonês
3244,Portugal,"Proudly boasting that there were no added sulphites in the winemaking process, this is a structured wine, firm with tannins that are backed with some juicy berry fruits. It is made to be drunk young although, in fact, it will be better with another six months of bottle aging, so wait until mid- 2016.",Terra d'Alter Zero SO2,89,14,Alentejano,Aragonês
19993,Portugal,"Smooth as Aragonês should be, here is a concentrated wine with obvious power. Its richness gives a velvet character, but underneath that is a series of dark tannins, brooding black fruits. Age for 3–4 years.",A,91,40,Alentejano,Aragonês
20473,Portugal,"Rich and soft, very smooth, this Alentejo version of Tinta Roriz in the Douro is ripe, rounded, full. It has tannins, although these integrate well with the rounded texture. There is a sense of power, but not overwhelming.",Vila Santa,89,20,Alentejano,Aragonês

102952,Portugal,"The local version of the Spanish Tempranillo, this is a firm, but wood- tinged wine, a core of acidity and black skin flavors giving a dense concentration to the wine, and contrasting with the great finishing acidity.",,89,18,Alentejano,Aragonês
103244,Portugal,"A soft, but spicy wine made from the Portuguese version of Tempranillo, giving rounded, silky tannins, balanced with fresh red berry fruits. With its acid highlights, it needs time to calm down, but it should be attractively ripe in one year.",,89,,Alentejano,Aragonês
103534,Portugal,"Big and dense, the tannins showing a dusty character from the heat of 2003 and the long, dry harvest. The wine shows plenty of structure, the fruits are big and jammy, very hot and ripe. Acidity seems to be missing, though with all this ripe fruit around.",,88,,Alentejano,Aragonês
103830,Portugal,"Smooth, wood-polished wine, packed with a ripe, comfortable texture, very ripe red fruits, highlights of tannins. There are black figs, balanced with sweet acidity and fattened with some bacon flavors.",,88,20,Alentejano,Aragonês

129656,Portugal,"Aragonês (Tinta Roriz or Tempranillo) is given intense power in the Alentejo. It has sold fruits, black cherry and spice flavors, with a big shoulder of tannins and vivid acidity. A wine for aging—3 to 4 years.",Aragonês da Peceguina,90,50,Alentejano,Aragonês
143568,Portugal,"Clearly made with lofty aims, this wine displays great intensity. The aromas of fresh-sawn wood and vanilla are nearly overpowering, while the fruit is concentrated and plummy, with a large dose of tannins that dry out the finish. Give it a few years to settle down and it will be more approachable and hopefully more complex as well.",Colheita Seleccionada,87,45,Alentejo,Aragonês
