This is Mastroberardino's flagship red.",Naturalis Historia,93,65,Southern Italy,Aglianico

38362,Spain,"Murky mucky passion fruit and pineapple aromas are uncommon and uninviting. This feels watery and a bit citrusy, while strained mango and passion fruit flavors end bitter, pithy and lean.",,82,26,Galicia,Albariño
39040,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Pazo Barrantes,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
39273,Spain,"Ripe apple aromas make the nose nice, even though it's flattening with age. Likewise on the palate, which delivers pithy orange and dry melon flavors along with indications that it's just starting to fade. Notes of green herbs and scallion come up on the finish. Drink this mature white immediately.",,88,17,Galicia,Albariño
40744,Spain,"Stony aromas of green melon and apple are mellow and classy. This is fresh on the palate, with a burst of acidity to brighten things up. Flavors of citrus fruits, green apple, nectarine and stony minerality finish similarly.",,90,22,Galicia,Albariño
40765,Spain,"Dusty apple aromas are given lift courtesy of citrus notes. This feels good on the palate, with zesty acidity. Flavors of stone fruits, tropical fruits, apple and citrus meld together well, while the finish is pure and long.",,90,17,Galicia,Albariño
41167,Spain,"Salinic, crisp and peachy on the nose, with easy, ripe melon aromas to sweeten it up. Shows good body and spritz alongside tropical flavors of orange and melon. Finishes with weight before rolling away with elegance. Punchy and ready to go.",,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
41512,Spain,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas.

41636,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
42160,US,"Albariño is very sensitive to the slightest usage of oak. Although this wine has only a touch of neutral oak, the wood still sticks out. The barrel influence gives it a buttered toast and caramel heaviness. Try this as an alternative to Chardonnay.",Jesperson Ranch,84,27,California,Albariño
42985,Spain,"Citrus and apple aromas are straightforward. This feels mostly good on the palate, with some flab and grab. Citric-leaning flavors of grapefruit and orange are softened by nectarine notes, while the finish is clampy like the palate.",,88,17,Galicia,Albariño
43335,Spain,"Starts out with gentle matchstick aromas, but with time it's all about white fruits, green herbs and apple. The palate has a firm, standard, high-quality mouthfeel along with tart apple, white peach and pineapple flavors. The finish is pure lime and snap, while the refreshment quotient runs long and strong.",,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
43369,Spain,"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia. Given its price, it boasts solid if pithy apple and gooseberry flavors, modest elegance and only a touch of bitterness on a green fruit finish. Drink soon.",Viña 24,86,10,Catalonia,Albariño
44106,Spain,"Fresh and easy to like. Smells clean and open, with peach and other white fruit aromas. You name the white or citrus fruit, and it's here: pineapple, grapefruit, mango and lime. Hits both the sweet and citrusy bases.",Valiñas,86,14,Galicia,Albariño
44191,Spain,"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",,85,15,Galicia,Albariño
44216,Spain,"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",,85,18,Galicia,Albariño
44502,Spain,"Peach, melon, apple and minerally aromas are easy to like. This has a standard Rías Baixas feel and moderate citric acidity. Flavors of melon and nectarine finish nice and a bit sweet. Call this textbook Albariño and enjoy it.",,88,17,Galicia,Albariño
44954,Spain,"Yellowing and leesy in character, with a deep, brooding style. Struggles to keep its pulse up; the core flavors are in the bland citrus category, while peachy, leesy secondary flavors turn pithy on the finish. Tasted twice with consistent notes.",,85,19,Galicia,Albariño
45088,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes.

A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",,89,18,Galicia,Albariño
45709,US,"Kenneth Volk is the Central Coast master of nontraditional California varieties. His take on Albariño delivers peach, citrus and mineral aromas, reflective of the historic Riverbench Vineyard. The taste comes on a tad juicy, then wipes away quickly, with apple tartness on the finish.",Riverbench Vineyard,87,24,California,Albariño
46276,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
46335,Spain,"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
46448,Spain,"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner. Drink right away; it's not meant for keeping. Imported by European Cellars.",,91,25,Galicia,Albariño
46671,US,"A pleasing Albarino from a new Lodi producer and longtime grower family, this wine has an inviting flowery nose and sharpness of acidity with good follow-through, as well as nice tropical fruit flavors. The sweetness on the finish might not be for everyone.",,87,19,California,Albariño
46835,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18,Galicia,Albariño
47132,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
47142,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29,Galicia,Albariño
47179,US,"A near-perfect Albariño, bone dry, acidic and slightly green, with lime and mineral flavors. Totally cleanses the palate. A great cocktail sipper, or try with little Spanish-style tapas.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño

47298,US,"Aromas of ripe ruby-red grapefruit mix with scents of wet sand in this stainless-steel and cold-fermented white. It delivers plush melon, citrus and a bit of bubble gum on the palate before ceding to powerful acidity. There is perhaps something disjointed in the ripe fruit flavors meeting up with bracing acidity, but it's a memorable sipper nonetheless.",Kristy Vineyard,86,24,California,Albariño
47579,US,"The 11th vintage of Abacela's Albariño is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon. There's a trace of oyster shell minerality and a bracing whiff of sea breeze on the finish.",,89,18,Oregon,Albariño
48090,Spain,"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors. There's snap to the finish but not a lot of flavor other than simple citrus. A good quaffer but nothing more than that.",,86,22,Galicia,Albariño
48643,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Verdemar,87,14,Galicia,Albariño
48816,Spain,"Montecillo's first effort with Albariño is perfectly crisp and pleasant. The nose offers pure citrus and tropical fruit, the feel is even and balanced, and the flavors are dry and veer toward apple and green melon. Long on the finish and nicely integrated; one of the best under-$15 Albariños going. Imported by Underdog Wine Merchants.",Verdemar,88,14,Galicia,Albariño
49135,Spain,"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors. Controlled heft, weight and spritz on the finish make it a solid bet. Look for the weird blue bottle and take it from there. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
49429,Spain,"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors.

49586,US,"Albariño works in California when it's completely dry and minerally, because the variety's high acidity and citrus flavors make for a crisp, mouthwatering wine. The trouble with this one is that it's not dry. It has sugary citrus flavors, and that makes it acceptable but disappointing from this fine producer.",Las Brisas Vineyard,84,18,California,Albariño
49825,Spain,"Very clean and clear, and even though it's a 2009 it is still holding onto its core freshness and character.

Albariño at its best.",,90,30,Galicia,Albariño
50023,Spain,"Nice and friendly but also a little flatter than in years past.

50451,Spain,"Can't call it floral and bright on the nose, but it's not over the hill or maderized, either; more neutral than anything.

A smooth operator with depth, minerality and fine acidity.",,89,27,Galicia,Albariño
50453,Spain,"Creamy and powdery on the nose, with sweetness and leesy notes. The palate is round, smooth and not terribly cutting, while the flavors lean toward honey, melon and another shot of lees.

50610,US,"Abacela has single-handedly revolutionized winemaking in southern Oregon, introducing Iberian varieties with great success. This estate-grown Albariño is a high-acid wine, still spritzy and reduced when first opened. With breathing time it cleans up and shows the beginnings of varietal character.",,87,18,Oregon,Albariño
51031,Spain,"Opens with vanilla and minerality along with standard apple and peach aromas.

Dry and subtle at all points.",,89,24,Galicia,Albariño
51038,Spain,"Floral and lightly tropical on the nose, and totally pleasant. The palate is pure and lively, with elegance and some spritz.

Finishes fresh and minerally.",Abadia de San Campio,88,20,Galicia,Albariño
52932,Spain,"A solid Albariño and an improvement over the previous vintage. Vanilla and apple aromas are standard and good, while the palate is plump, fresh, melony and peachy, with softness but no flab. Drink this wine right away (summer sipping) because it's not going to make it until 2012.",Zios de Lusco,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
53571,Spain,"With its apple, peach and melon aromas, the bouquet is solid. The palate is a bit spritzy and spread thin, and that's confirmed via fleshy, dilute flavors of white peach and green melon. Plump and simple on the finish; good for salads, shrimp and grilled white meats.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
53612,US,"An easy to drink white wine, of a style increasingly popular. It's unoaked, allowing pure citrus, honey and spice flavors to star. Brisk Edna Valley acids and minerals make the mouthfeel lively.",Paragon Vineyard,87,17,California,Albariño
54179,Spain,"Crisp and neutral in style, from nose to tail. The bouquet is firm and condensed, with nothing too floral or blowsy to latch onto. In the mouth, it's tight as a drum, with limited green apple flavors and a drip of honey. Well dressed but nothing fancy or overly flavorful.",Esencia Diviña,87,23,Galicia,Albariño
55378,Spain,"Peach is the lead aroma on the nose, which is also a bit heavy and slightly vegetal. Full and chunky in the mouth, with pithy, mildly bitter apple and melon flavors. Finishes soft and pithy. One of the more fuller-bodied Albariños out there.",Pazo Barrantes,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
55629,Spain,"Zarate is known for its late-release, leesy Albariños balanced by shearing acidity. El Palomar is cut from that cloth; it shows baked apple, oak and warmth on the nose, while the palate is razor sharp, with clean-cutting acidity. Flavors of vanilla and toast mix with spice and citrus, while the finish is long and woody, but not resiny or thick. Drink  through 2015.",El Palomar,90,60,Galicia,Albariño
55658,Spain,"The price is too elevated given that the wine is simple and already fading. Aromas of peach and melon are soft and a touch mealy, and so is the palate, which has a flat feel and flavors of papaya, melon and apple. Finishes pulpy and with the first hints of maderization.",Leirana,86,40,Galicia,Albariño
55990,Spain,"Melon and buttercup aromas are clean, inviting and exactly what you should expect from Albariño. The palate is also a success, with apple, pineapple and citrus flavors.

56199,Spain,"An Albariño with some body and complexity, Nora's single-vineyard, barrel-aged wine is definitely an oaky one. It has lots of wood dust, vanilla and lemon curd on the nose. The flavor profile is led by apples and cinnamon (from the oak), and it flows well. Not a sticky, overoaked load; instead it has balance and quasi-Burgundian feel.",,89,28,Galicia,Albariño
56290,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
56303,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
56458,Spain,"Given that this leesy Albariño is pushing eight years in age, it's remarkably healthy. Stony, briny aromas override residual fruit aromas, while the palate remains zesty. Flavors of white grapefruit and nectarine finish citric and solid.  This is a unique style of wine that no other winery in Rías Baixas is making.",Selección de Añada,89,75,Galicia,Albariño
56524,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet.

56904,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate.

57392,Spain,"Wet and zesty white wine from Northwest Spain? Sounds good to us. Salneval is from Condes de Albarei, and it offers perfectly proper peach, melon and pastry aromas. The palate is lithe and fresh, with orange and apple. Yes, it's straightforward and common. But it is also clean, balanced and will drink well with all sorts of finger foods, salads and seafood.",Salneval,87,10,Galicia,Albariño
57737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Albariño
58313,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17,Galicia,Albariño
58616,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
58861,Spain,"Gold in color, with mineral, toast, baked apple and stone-fruit aromas, this Albariño is plump and mature on the palate.

58869,Spain,"This mature Albariño is mellow on the nose, then wide and melony in feel. It's leesy but also healthy in terms of acidity, with flavors of papaya, melon and peach. It's flavorful for sure, but a touch bland on the finish.",Don Álvaro de Bazán,88,,Galicia,Albariño
58960,Spain,"This is what Albariño is all about! The nose issues a salinic combo of salt water and sea shells along with green banana and melon, while the palate is jumpy, fresh, balanced and intriguing. The flavors of just-ripe bananas and Meyer lemon are true, while the mouthfeel is both smooth and refreshing. Get after this one as soon as you can.",,91,17,Galicia,Albariño
59254,US,"A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.",Ca' del Solo Vineyard,89,20,California,Albariño
59564,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28,Galicia,Albariño
59874,Spain,"Now this is Albariño! The nose sings a pretty tune, backed by aromas of white fruits, candle wax and flower blossoms.

You won't be disappointed.",,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
60003,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness. With its citrus, pepper and flower flavors, it's perfect on its own, or with Asian, Mexican and grilled pork dishes.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño
60405,Spain,"Young and vibrant; it's straightforward Albariño from a good vintage. In the mouth, expect green melon and stone-fruit flavors backed by solid acidity and a bit of fleshy weight.

60515,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet.

62086,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits.

Drink now.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
62296,Spain,"Light and limpid, with mild almond, palm butter and citrus aromas. This is a basic, clean wine that offers citrus, pineapple and mango flavors.

62504,US,"Even by Albariño standards, this is a particularly dry, acidic wine. It's what you look for, and what you get, in this wine from Bonny Doon's Randall Grahm.

62505,US,"Albariño's natural acidity is amplified in this wine, which comes from one of California's chilliest growing regions and the coolest vintage in years.

62914,Spain,"Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine. But the 2005 cost $15 and this one is going for $28. Can somebody please explain the drastic price hike?",,87,28,Galicia,Albariño
62919,Spain,"Salneval is the so-called baby Albariño from Condes de Albarei, and it's lively and complete.

63477,Spain,"A heavier, sweeter style with cider-like aromas followed by apple and lime flavors. In the mouth, this is a more citric wine that may go well with shellfish. It's sturdy and zesty, but not that evolved. Tasted twice, with this note reflecting the better of the two bottles.",Esencia Diviña,85,19,Galicia,Albariño
63810,Spain,"Round and sweet, with heavy buttercup and honeyed aromas. This is what we call a candied Albariño; it's loaded up with canned pineapple, melon and mango. The feel is plump and the acid level fairly low. Ripe and ready as it's ever going to be.",,85,13,Galicia,Albariño
64331,Spain,"Sharp and sweaty on the nose, with bulky passion fruit, scallion and citrus flavors. This wine is on its last legs; it's soft, fleshy and starting to lose its final vestiges of freshness. You'll be better off waiting for the 2006, assuming it gets to market soon.",,83,22,Galicia,Albariño
64352,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily.

64448,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine.

65943,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime.

Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Albariño

66223,US,"This is a really terrific white wine, from a variety that's fast gaining traction, although few are producing it. More should.

68804,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",,84,15,Galicia,Albariño
69242,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much.

71501,Spain,"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",,87,25,Galicia,Albariño

Creamy but balanced on the finish; meets or beats any reasonable expectation for fine Albariño.",,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
78662,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance.

89768,Spain,"Apple and other white fruit aromas come with hints of sea foam and clam shell. The palate is tight, mineral-driven and citric, with some spritz. Flavors of apple and pithy citrus lead to a long, speedy finish, with generous acidity.",Esencia Diviña,89,23,Galicia,Albariño
90003,Spain,"Pungent and sweaty smelling on first blush, almost suggesting Verdejo or Sauvignon Blanc. It remains oily and nettled on the nose, with sharpness. Sooner rather than later it softens, unveiling flavors of green melon, passionfruit and citrus. And the finish goes out with snap, orange and grapefruit. Potent for the variety.",,87,22,Galicia,Albariño
90086,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
90188,Spain,"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in. The flavors are peach, apricot and ripe citrus fruits, and the finish is pithy and wide. Plods along a bit; could stand to be lighter and smoother in scope.",Pazo Barrantes,87,23,Galicia,Albariño
90223,Spain,"Big and sort of disinterested for Albariño, with a clipped, citrusy palate that's choppy, salinic and green. There's green melon and minerality here, but for a new-vintage wine it seems middling in its focus and intensity.",,85,19,Galicia,Albariño
90339,Spain,"Clean and fresh, this features largely neutral, mineral-driven aromas that hint at white fruit and melon. Citrus, particularly white grapefruit, is the lead flavor, while background notes of pith, melon and green banana make appearances. Fresh, crisp and nice on the finish.",Single Vineyard,88,20,Galicia,Albariño
91210,Spain,"Husky on the nose but mostly it comes across as wild, with jumpy, loud pear, melon and apple aromas. The mouth is spunky and all over the map, while flavors of tangy yellow fruits carry an acidic, herbal twinge and even a grassy quality. Lacks perfect poise but it can't be called timid or dull.",Pazo Barrantes,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
91465,Spain,"Tan-gold in color, with a mustardy, somewhat rustic bouquet that's salinic and short on snappy fruit. The palate is chunky, with melon and apple for flavors. Seems low on pulse; the bet here is this was better six months ago and is now in decline.",,84,15,Galicia,Albariño
91582,Spain,"Apart from its note of fresh apple and hint of juniper, the nose is fairly neutral. It feels clean, crisp and cleansing, with pear and nectarine flavors that finish light, with medium intensity and length. Drink right away for maximum freshness and expression.",,88,18,Galicia,Albariño
91896,Spain,"Montecillo's first effort with Albariño is perfectly crisp and pleasant. The nose offers pure citrus and tropical fruit, the feel is even and balanced, and the flavors are dry and veer toward apple and green melon. Long on the finish and nicely integrated; one of the best under-$15 Albariños going. Imported by Underdog Wine Merchants.",Verdemar,88,14,Galicia,Albariño
92215,Spain,"With mineral, apple and peach aromas, this gets off on the right footing. The palate is zesty and acidic, with a tangy set of apple, citrus and mineral flavors. Controlled heft, weight and spritz on the finish make it a solid bet. Look for the weird blue bottle and take it from there. Imported by W.J. Deutsch & Sons.",,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
92466,Spain,"This is as basic as Albariño gets, with aromas of sweet apple and pear. It feels round and a bit soft, with fleshy peach and dry melon flavors. The finish is pithy, with a white pepper note and an indication that the wine is starting to fade. Drink immediately.",,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
92482,Spain,"Yellow in color, with buttercup, wild flower and leesy white-fruit aromas, this feels spritzy, with melon, papaya and white peach flavors. It's mildly minerally and dry in flavor on the finish. Drink as soon as possible.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
92509,Spain,"More familiar and less unusual than prior vintages. This wine deals typical, upright lemon, lime and tropical fruit aromas backed by green apple and lemon-based flavors.

93103,Spain,"Nice and friendly but also a little flatter than in years past.

93672,Spain,"Peach, melon and pithy aromas work the opening, followed by a leesy palate of mild peach, nectarine and melon flavors. It offers good flow to the finish, which features notes of sea foam, white fruit and mineral, as well as a spot of bitterness. Drink now.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
93690,US,"Abacela has single-handedly revolutionized winemaking in southern Oregon, introducing Iberian varieties with great success.

94059,US,"This Albariño is a pretty little wine and refreshingly different. There's subtle white flowers and quince upfront, followed by a light-bodied but intensely perfumed palate. While the mouth is a bit soft, this wine ends with a refreshing kick of acid. Try with light fish dishes.",,83,24,Virginia,Albariño
94852,Spain,"An animal cracker aroma accompanies notes of peach and mineral. Spritzy, fresh and citrusy in the mouth, this features orange and peach flavors. The finish has a pithy bitterness.",Edición Especial 10 Años,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
96058,Spain,"Gold in color, this has chunky aromas of oily white fruit and sea water. Thick in feel, it nevertheless has enough acidity to protect the wine's body and integrity. It tastes of orange and nectarine, before falling flat and mealy on the finish.",,85,23,Galicia,Albariño
96562,Spain,"An elegant and well-made Albariño with lemon chiffon, pear and green apple aromas.

Drink this pretty wine as soon as possible.",,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
98295,Spain,"Starts out with gentle matchstick aromas, but with time it's all about white fruits, green herbs and apple. The palate has a firm, standard, high-quality mouthfeel along with tart apple, white peach and pineapple flavors. The finish is pure lime and snap, while the refreshment quotient runs long and strong.",,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
98854,US,"A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.",Ca' del Solo Vineyard,89,20,California,Albariño
99319,US,"A near-perfect Albariño, bone dry, acidic and slightly green, with lime and mineral flavors. Totally cleanses the palate. A great cocktail sipper, or try with little Spanish-style tapas.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño

99879,US,"Even in the cool 2011 vintage, this wine really shines. It's bone dry, low in alcohol and high in acidity, making it a delicious accompaniment to a range of foods. Complex citrus, white flower and mineral flavors carry it over the goal line. This is one of the best Albariños of the vintage.",,92,20,California,Albariño
100127,US,"A beautiful white wine notable for its extreme dryness and fresh crispness of acidity. Really cleanses the mouth, letting it appreciate the unoaked flavors of tangerine, melon, peach and minerals. A brilliant wine to drink with almost anything, but especially shellfish.",Paragon Vineyard,91,17,California,Albariño
100946,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
101325,Spain,"Clean and smooth to open, with a hint of salinity, powdered sugar and peach. The palate is sheer and zesty, with lemon, green apple and tangy acidity. Crisp yet angular on the finish, but good in a narrow, lean, drilling sort of way.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
101631,US,"A pleasing Albarino from a new Lodi producer and longtime grower family, this wine has an inviting flowery nose and sharpness of acidity with good follow-through, as well as nice tropical fruit flavors. The sweetness on the finish might not be for everyone.",,87,19,California,Albariño
102709,Spain,"With dusty apple cider aromas and tingling acidity, this seems a lot like Galician Albariño even though it's from Costers del Segre in Catalonia. Given its price, it boasts solid if pithy apple and gooseberry flavors, modest elegance and only a touch of bitterness on a green fruit finish. Drink soon.",Viña 24,86,10,Catalonia,Albariño
103023,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness. With its citrus, pepper and flower flavors, it's perfect on its own, or with Asian, Mexican and grilled pork dishes.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño
103170,Spain,"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors. There's snap to the finish but not a lot of flavor other than simple citrus. A good quaffer but nothing more than that.",,86,22,Galicia,Albariño
103591,Spain,"The name means “Sea of Vines,” and that's what you see in Rías Baixas. Here, we have a dry, crisp white with apple and apricot on the nose and a bit of roundness, weight and chunkiness in the mouth. Tastes of pithy apple and apricot, with mild bitterness on the finish. Drink now.",,85,15,Galicia,Albariño
103616,Spain,"Light, simple and ready to drink. More acidic than some, with a cleansing, almost sour flavor package of green apple and lemon. Shows a lot of unabsorbed acidity on the finish, which forces the wine toward being crisp and minimalist. Drink now.",,85,18,Galicia,Albariño
103937,US,"Bone dry and crisp, this white wine shows flavors of citrus fruits, minerals and white pepper. It's an elegant sipper that will go well with Spanish-style tapas dishes.",,87,16,California,Albariño
104025,Spain,"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas.

Drink now.",,91,25,Galicia,Albariño
104133,Spain,"Vionta aims for the racy, lively style of Albariño, and for the most part it nails it. Aromas of peach and nectarine are youthful and pure, while the flavors of apple, peach and lime are pleasant. Not over the top but instead it achieves balance and ease. Imported by Freixenet, USA.",Estate Bottled Single Vineyard Limited Release,88,18,Galicia,Albariño
104147,Spain,"May be getting old but still welcoming and mostly fresh. Citrus, melon and mango flavors are flush and clean, and the finish is racy and fluid. Normally Albariño is a one-year wine, meaning you should drink it in the year immediately after harvest. Here's an '05 that's hanging in there and still showing kick. Drink now for best results.",Turonia,88,20,Galicia,Albariño
104632,Spain,"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Erxebre,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
104696,US,"Albariño works in California when it's completely dry and minerally, because the variety's high acidity and citrus flavors make for a crisp, mouthwatering wine. The trouble with this one is that it's not dry. It has sugary citrus flavors, and that makes it acceptable but disappointing from this fine producer.",Las Brisas Vineyard,84,18,California,Albariño
104788,US,"Shows the qualities that are making this Spanish variety so popular. Bone dry, crisp in acidity, low in alcohol and palate-stimulating, this oak-free wine bursts with rich lemongrass, pineapple and peach flavors. That acidity makes it clean and vibrant and terrifically versatile at the table.",,87,16,California,Albariño
105702,US,"This elegant, sophisticated wine confirms Longoria's reputation as one of the premier Albariño producers in California. As in past vintages, the wine is bone dry and crisp in acidity, with mineral, citrus zest and apricot flavors that finish with a honeyed richness.",Clover Creek Vineyard,92,23,California,Albariño
105973,Spain,"Peachy and waxy on the nose, with dry lemon and green-melon flavors. This is a small-production wine (1,000 cases total) that leans on core acidity to keep it propped and steady. It's not the most complex game in town, and maybe it's on its way to having seen better days even if 2005 was a benchmark vintage. Limited in its scope of flavors but lively courtesy of an extra boost of acidity.",Carballo Galego,86,20,Galicia,Albariño
106072,Spain,"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral. But as it opens you'll see that citrus, saline and tropical fruit flavors emerge. By the time it's fully unraveled the wine is smooth as glass, comfortable and just right for drinking now.",Brandal,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
106077,Spain,"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be. Thus it's fresh, smooth and tight, with hints of petrol, pepper and citrus pith toughening up the finish. Drink now.",,89,22,Galicia,Albariño
106361,Spain,"Clean and only ever so slightly waxy, with yellow-fruit aromas, mineral and floral scents all coming together. The palate is crisp, zesty and stony, with fresh Golden Delicious apple and tangerine flavors. All in all, the sum is more than satisfying. Drink as soon as possible.",,88,15,Galicia,Albariño
106561,US,"Think of this Albariño as a bone-dry, high-acid version of Pinot Grigio. That's the personality of this likeable young wine. The citrus and spicy fig flavors are pleasing, but could use greater fruity concentration, as the wine is a bit watery.",,85,17,California,Albariño
106666,Spain,"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",,88,22,Galicia,Albariño
107260,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
107273,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
107524,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
107844,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
107923,US,"Albariño is turning into my favorite dry white wine. It's what Pinot Gris/Grigio claimed to be, and so often isn't. This one's really dry and acidic, with really minerally citrus flavors. Bring on the salty tapas.",,90,18,California,Albariño
108043,Spain,"Stylistically and individually, this is not what this critic is looking for in Albariño. The wine is moderately but noticeably oaked, and seeing that it dates from 2003, it has aged to the point that there's butterscotch and canned-corn aromas reminiscent of warm-climate Chardonnay. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish, and the acidity seems forced. Not poorly made but not really what Albariño should be.",Granbazán Ambar Limousin,83,35,Galicia,Albariño
108369,Spain,"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with. The flavors are of apple and melon, and the finish is pithy and turns bitter toward the final stages. Not really what we're looking for from Rías Baixas.",Gran Vinum,82,24,Galicia,Albariño
108737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Albariño
108998,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine. It cleanses the mouth with scoury flavors of lychee, lime, nectarine, minerals and peppery nasturtium, with a foresty, resinous quality suggesting pine cone.",Ca' del Solo Estate Vineyard,91,20,California,Albariño
109060,Spain,"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting. The palate is easy and light in the middle, and along the edges apricot and citrus flavors are pleasant. Finishes round, with apple and melon notes. Drink right away.",,87,12,Galicia,Albariño
109436,US,"Granted, there haven't been that many, but this is the best California Albariño I've had. A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored. Candied citrus zest, peach pie, pink grapefruit, buttery honeysuckle, apricot, nectarine, and no oak because it doesn't need any. A spectacular food wine or just cocktail. Shows the promise of this variety in the right climate.",Clover Creek Vineyard,93,26,California,Albariño
110534,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28,Galicia,Albariño
110573,Spain,"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Pazo Barrantes,86,23,Galicia,Albariño
110578,Spain,"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Gran Vinum,85,24,Galicia,Albariño
110789,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
111078,Spain,"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",,81,14,Galicia,Albariño
111085,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19,Galicia,Albariño
111168,Spain,"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
111933,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
111958,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Albariño
112076,Spain,"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
112132,US,"I wish this wine were drier because it has polished citrus, floral and mineral flavors and a rich, pronounced acidity. But it's sugary throughout.",Danza Blanca,83,10,California,Albariño
112537,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
112608,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
113086,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
113150,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
113416,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",,87,16,Galicia,Albariño
113506,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",,85,13,Galicia,Albariño
113963,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",,88,14,Galicia,Albariño
114365,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",,84,21,Galicia,Albariño
114526,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
114802,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
114914,Spain,"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Contrapunto,82,13,Galicia,Albariño
115028,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",,91,15,Galicia,Albariño
115297,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",,91,22,Galicia,Albariño
115303,Spain,"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.",Dona Rosa,91,17,Galicia,Albariño
115346,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
115813,US,"This is a new wine from the family that runs Baileyana. The Albariño is stunning in its purity. It's built along the lines of a Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio with the most wonderfully detailed citrus, fig and herbed chêvre flavors. Just a beautiful glass of wine.",,90,17,California,Albariño
116089,US,"With this bracing, bone-dry, crisply mineral white wine, Abacela continues to prove that southern Oregon is really the westernmost province of Spain.

116132,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Albariño
117005,Spain,"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Dona Rosa,90,18,Galicia,Albariño
117133,Spain,"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Premium,89,17,Galicia,Albariño
117608,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15,Galicia,Albariño
117610,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas. But for anyone who likes fresh, pulpy juice, it tastes perfectly good.",Granbazán Ambar,85,19,Galicia,Albariño
117736,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
119348,US,"Grown in the Carneros, this beautiful Albariño has just a touch of oak that adds a creamy butteriness to the texture. But the mouthfeel belongs to crisp acidity and rewardingly complex tangerine, Meyer lemon, nectarine and mineral flavors that go on and on into the finish. A brilliant success. Try as an upscale alternative to Sauvignon Blanc.",,91,22,California,Albariño
119552,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Albariño
121668,US,"The combination of stainless-steel and oak-barrel fermentation has been good for this wine. It's bright and steely in acidity, and lifts the variety's mineral and citrus flavors to new heights, adding a rich level of smoky cream. Just beautiful and versatile at the table, a sommelier's dream wine. Production was a mere 850 cases.",Limited Release,91,22,California,Albariño
121907,Spain,"Códax really got it good in 2007. This is one of this co-op's best-balanced, easy-to-like bottlings we can remember. The bouquet is clean as a whistle, with pear, apple and slate. Graceful on the palate, with citrus and green-apple flavors. A little lime carves shape into the long finish. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
122603,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17,Galicia,Albariño
122906,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
122998,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes. Shows just enough body, acid and pith on the finish, but drink now before it starts to fade.",,89,18,Galicia,Albariño
123043,US,"This is a really terrific white wine, from a variety that's fast gaining traction, although few are producing it. More should. It's classically dry and crisp, with mineral-infused flavors of apricots, green apples and spices. So good and complex, and exceptionally versatile at the table.",Estate Grown Produced and Bottled,91,22,California,Albariño
123260,Spain,"Crisp, clean and minerally on the nose, with apple and green-fruit aromas. It has a round, smooth feel and flavors of peach, apple and citrus that will enliven the palate and aid almost any seafood, vegetable or salad. A natural wine with just enough powdery sweetness to raise a smile.",,89,18,Galicia,Albariño
124219,US,"A near-perfect Albariño, bone dry, acidic and slightly green, with lime and mineral flavors. Totally cleanses the palate. A great cocktail sipper, or try with little Spanish-style tapas.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño
124246,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas. There's punch and spritz on the palate as well as sweet citrus and juicy lime flavors that break up a little as they fan out. Not sure if there's residual sugar, but the wine tastes a bit sweet.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
124277,US,"A beautiful white wine notable for its extreme dryness and fresh crispness of acidity. Really cleanses the mouth, letting it appreciate the unoaked flavors of tangerine, melon, peach and minerals. A brilliant wine to drink with almost anything, but especially shellfish.",Paragon Vineyard,91,17,California,Albariño
124721,US,"Albariño is one of those new white wine varieties that's creating such interest. This wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with honey-infused flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and wildflowers. It's a great sipper and so versatile with everything from Mexican to Vietnamese.",Terra Alta Vineyard,88,16,California,Albariño
124805,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins. There's nothing not to like about this Albariño, which is pure, pithy on the finish, and more than solid in a pedestrian, familiar sort of way.",Single Vineyard,88,18,Galicia,Albariño
125072,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance. Powerful acidity pushes it in the right direction, and the finish of lychee, passion fruit and nectarine is lasting. Very nice wine but relatively high in price.",,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
125082,Spain,"Stylistically, this is at odds with what I feel Albariño should be. That said, it's a well-executed and well-made barrel-fermented white with full-force toast and popcorn aromas followed by a resiny, vanilla-fueled flavor profile that folds in apple, banana and creamy frosting. Still vital and healthy after three years in bottle.",Nora da Neve,88,29,Galicia,Albariño
125290,Spain,"For inexpensive Albariño, Nessa delivers the goods. The nose is flowery and soft, but most of all it's inviting. The palate is easy and light in the middle, and along the edges apricot and citrus flavors are pleasant. Finishes round, with apple and melon notes. Drink right away.",,87,12,Galicia,Albariño
126003,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness. With its citrus, pepper and flower flavors, it's perfect on its own, or with Asian, Mexican and grilled pork dishes.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño
126583,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Verdemar,87,14,Galicia,Albariño
126803,Spain,"Almond, sherry and banana aromas start it out. The palate is mellow and smooth, with apple and touches of lemon. There's ring and some zing on the finish, but not too much as the wine is beginning to show signs of reaching early maturity. Drink immediately.",Pazo Barrantes,86,23,Galicia,Albariño
126808,Spain,"Tan in color, with short flashes of apple and spice on the bouquet. The palate has a small level of oxidation, while the mouthfeel benefits from smooth but present acidity. Limited in scope and flavor, but solid for a wine that's beginning to fade.",Gran Vinum,85,24,Galicia,Albariño
126917,US,"Bone dry and crisp, this white wine shows flavors of citrus fruits, minerals and white pepper. It's an elegant sipper that will go well with Spanish-style tapas dishes.",,87,16,California,Albariño
128868,Spain,"Past its prime. The nose is heavy and the palate deals minimal peach flavors. It's wet but losing clarity, with bland apple and pear flavors left on the finish. This is not quite dead but best to wait for 2007.",,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
129376,Spain,"First time we've rated this Albariño, and we love it, especially for the price. It's lightly honeyed on the nose, with accents of white pepper and peach. The palate is clean as a glass table, mildly creamy yet properly acidic. It's based on apple-pie flavors and the finish is long and plentiful.",,91,16,Galicia,Albariño
129386,Spain,"A delicious wine that's entirely impressive in the way it delivers smooth, subtle citrus and honey aromas in front of a generous but controlled palate of tangerine, apple, lemon and spice. A luxurious, smooth experience, with a sexy mouthfeel and finely integrated acidity. Expensive for Albariño, but fewer than 3,000 cases were produced.",Selección,91,29,Galicia,Albariño
130209,US,"So crisply tart, so mouthwatering, it's just a pleasure to drink. Harvested at a brix of only 21.3, with alcohol of just 12.4%, the wine is completely dry, yet offers rich, forward flavors of citrus fruits, white peaches, green apples, honeysuckle flowers, minerals and spices.",Clover Creek Vineyard,90,23,California,Albariño
130333,US,"Albariño is turning into my favorite dry white wine. It's what Pinot Gris/Grigio claimed to be, and so often isn't. This one's really dry and acidic, with really minerally citrus flavors. Bring on the salty tapas.",,90,18,California,Albariño
130359,US,"This Albariño is a pretty little wine and refreshingly different. There's subtle white flowers and quince upfront, followed by a light-bodied but intensely perfumed palate. While the mouth is a bit soft, this wine ends with a refreshing kick of acid. Try with light fish dishes.",,83,24,Virginia,Albariño
130385,Spain,"This is showing mineral, saline, spice, peach and melon—all good signs. The palate leans toward tropical, with pineapple leading the way. With no surprises, it finishes clean and a touch fleshy. An excellent Albariño that's maturing quickly. Drink now.",Dona Rosa,90,18,Galicia,Albariño
130646,US,"Granted, there haven't been that many, but this is the best California Albariño I've had. A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored. Candied citrus zest, peach pie, pink grapefruit, buttery honeysuckle, apricot, nectarine, and no oak because it doesn't need any. A spectacular food wine or just cocktail. Shows the promise of this variety in the right climate.",Clover Creek Vineyard,93,26,California,Albariño
130963,Spain,"The gold tint may look imposing, and it does signal a richer-styled wine. But let this heavier, more ripe Albariño roll over your palate and you'll probably wind up liking its citrus and nectarine flavors but softer body. Finishes with apricot, kumquat and vanilla notes. An interesting wine to drink now.",Premium,89,17,Galicia,Albariño
131715,Spain,"This is Albariño in fine form. The nose is succulent and marble-smooth, with pure citrus and melon aromas. The palate is lively but refined, with exuberant citrus flavors that come on strong but with proper restraint. Long and ripe on the finish, which only adds to the experience. Drink now.",,91,25,Galicia,Albariño
131918,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine. It cleanses the mouth with scoury flavors of lychee, lime, nectarine, minerals and peppery nasturtium, with a foresty, resinous quality suggesting pine cone.",Ca' del Solo Estate Vineyard,91,20,California,Albariño
132292,Spain,"With a gold glint and put-together aromas of peach, candle wax, mineral and citrus, this is very nice Albariño that's now fully ripe, mature and drinking at its best. The palate pits juicy melon against dry papaya; it's big, ripe, full and the perfect foil for all sorts of white-friendly foods. Only 1,000 cases made of this reserve-style wine.",Erxebre,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
132438,Spain,"Fairly agile, floral and friendly, with precise peach, nectarine and citrus flavors. With its easy personality and good mouthfeel, this is what you're looking for in a solid, everyday white wine.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
133286,Spain,"Sweet and fresh smelling, with aromas of lime, pear and peach. The palate is all about citrus, with some spice and mineral thrown in for good measure. Balanced and zesty, like Albariño should be.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
133358,Spain,"Not a bad value in the Albariño category. Alba Rosa is the second wine from Martinez Serantes, and it's yellowish in color, with a pineapple and pear nose. Solid in the mouth, with touches of apple, white peach and lime. Proper acidity keeps it fresh.",Alba Rosa,85,15,Galicia,Albariño
133360,Spain,"Cantaloupe, almond candy and orange blossom make for a sweet nose. The palate seems too close to orange juice and tangerine than the apple and peach that best defines Rías Baixas.

133739,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
133762,Spain,"This Albariño grows on you right away. The wine starts out shy and clean, almost as if it were neutral. But as it opens you'll see that citrus, saline and tropical fruit flavors emerge. By the time it's fully unraveled the wine is smooth as glass, comfortable and just right for drinking now.",Brandal,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
133767,Spain,"Ripe, tropical and laced with pineapple, nectarine, green banana and melon. This is the best Don Olegario we've had in the past three vintages, and that's because it's here in the year after harvest, as it should be. Thus it's fresh, smooth and tight, with hints of petrol, pepper and citrus pith toughening up the finish. Drink now.",,89,22,Galicia,Albariño
134051,Spain,"Clean and only ever so slightly waxy, with yellow-fruit aromas, mineral and floral scents all coming together. The palate is crisp, zesty and stony, with fresh Golden Delicious apple and tangerine flavors. All in all, the sum is more than satisfying. Drink as soon as possible.",,88,15,Galicia,Albariño
134236,Spain,Simple on the nose and like biting into a green apple when you taste it. There isn't much structure or grab to the wine; it's more like a wet wash of the mouth that finishes like ginger ale. An easy game to solve; drink now.,,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
134356,Spain,"A solid wine with mineral, white pepper and waxy fruit aromas. The palate is ripe and bulky, but also acidic enough to be balanced and stylish. Pineapple is the forceful flavor, while the finish is full and slightly oily. Drink this fruity, bigger-framed Albariño now.",,88,22,Galicia,Albariño
134716,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",,85,13,Galicia,Albariño
134812,US,"I wish this wine were drier because it has polished citrus, floral and mineral flavors and a rich, pronounced acidity. But it's sugary throughout.",Danza Blanca,83,10,California,Albariño
134913,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
134938,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Albariño
134950,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
134963,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
135244,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
135427,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
135564,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
135605,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",,84,21,Galicia,Albariño
135975,Spain,"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",,88,15,Galicia,Albariño
136070,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
136214,Spain,"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Contrapunto,82,13,Galicia,Albariño
136366,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",,87,16,Galicia,Albariño
136457,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Albariño
137216,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
138106,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
138254,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28,Galicia,Albariño
138439,US,"Grown in this cool appellation, this Spanish variety is crisp in acidity and bone dry, a refreshing sipper that shows flavors of citrus zest not unlike a Sauvignon Blanc, but fuller-bodied.",,87,17,California,Albariño
138476,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
138858,Spain,"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",,81,14,Galicia,Albariño
138865,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19,Galicia,Albariño
140563,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",,84,23,Galicia,Albariño
140564,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",,84,15,Galicia,Albariño
141452,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Gran Vinum,83,26,Galicia,Albariño
141732,Spain,"An Albariño-dominated middleweight with pure and pleasant aromas of pineapple, citrus and slate. Rich, round and defined, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Very much on the money, with curvy acids as opposed to spiky ones.",Condado de Tea,89,22,Galicia,Albariño
141741,Spain,"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.",Blanco,88,110,Galicia,Albariño
142613,Spain,"Clean and sweet, with an aromatic touch of cookies and cream. In the mouth, it's more of the standard lemon, apple and mineral that you expect from this Galician white. Finishes easy and nice, but not too crisp.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
142615,Spain,"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate. Tastes more of live-wire citrus than anything else, and the zesty finish definitely hums along at a quick pace. Lasting notes of grapefruit and mineral are typical and welcome.",,87,19,Galicia,Albariño
143081,Spain,"Light and easy, with simple aromas of lemon and wildflowers. Fairly forward and pronounced in terms of fruit; the lemon, pineapple and peach are all right there and lively. Finishes smooth and easy, if maybe a touch watery.",O Deus Dionisos,86,22,Galicia,Albariño
143087,Spain,"A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.",,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
143171,Spain,"Big-boned and citrusy, with aromas of oranges and melon. More citrus on the palate mixes with the essence of pear and apple, while the finish is tight and rather long. A bit lacking in depth, but ripe and forward. Satisfyingly simple.",,86,21,Galicia,Albariño
143391,Spain,"Starts off with heavy melon and citrus aromas, which are followed by tangy apple and pineapple flavors. Very zesty, with a certain sharpness that dumbs down any complexity that might be hiding.",,85,17,Galicia,Albariño
143445,Spain,"From the outset, this beauty oozes character. The whole exceeds the parts by a sum of three, as the wine delivers full flavors, complexity and a near Burgundian minerality. This is what great Albariño is about, even if it's from a hot vintage. Spicy yet thumping with guava, banana and citrus. Simply delicious.",Cepas Vellas,92,33,Galicia,Albariño
143703,Spain,"Floral and mildly leesy, with pungent aromas of green apple, citrus and honey. For anyone looking for steely, pure Albariño, the single-vineyard Fillaboa Monte Alto is the ticket.

144308,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",,91,15,Galicia,Albariño
144432,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be.

Drink now.",,90,24,Galicia,Albariño
144607,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",,91,22,Galicia,Albariño
144613,Spain,"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.",Dona Rosa,91,17,Galicia,Albariño
144965,Spain,"To date, this year's best value among Spanish white wines is this simple but lovely fruit bomb of an Albariño from the quality-driven Martín Códax cooperative. It literally overflows with peach blossom aromas and melon flavors. Brightly labeled with orange print, it's hard to miss. And you wouldn't want to.",,90,12,Galicia,Albariño
144974,Spain,"Full and robust in its approach. The bouquet is fragrant and expansive, with melon and honey aromas pouring forth with gusto. The flavors are quite delicious, a near-perfect blend of apple, melon and citrus. The word on the street is that 2005 Albariños offer great fruit-to-acid balance. This wine is an example of just that.",,90,18,Galicia,Albariño
144982,Spain,"Our favorite among this winery's 2005s, Ambar offers tight, dry, precise aromas backed by driving flavors of melon, peach and orange-blossom honey. Very much on the spot; an Albariño that you can't go wrong with.",Ambar,90,19,Galicia,Albariño

145176,Spain,"Ripe like many of the 2003s, but still a perfectly fine Albariño. The nose is clean and peachy, while light citrus, nectarine and apple control the palate. Nothing out of the ordinary: fine body and fresh lime on the finish. good as a first-course white.",,89,,Galicia,Albariño

145583,Spain,"Perfectly crisp and fresh, with touches of tangerine and lemon making it slightly sharp but not the least bit sour. More of a zesty version, with correct acidity, ripeness and balance. Yet another fine match for seafood.",,89,19,Galicia,Albariño
145589,Spain,"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms.

145869,Spain,"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Laxas,89,,Galicia,Albariño

Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35,Galicia,Albariño
146169,Spain,"More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white. In fact, everything about it is really good, from the crystalline nose to the ripe palate to the clean, exact finish.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
146183,Spain,"Floral, with buttercup and acacia on the nose. The mouth, however, is a bit more austere and sharp-edged. It delivers steely, bracing acids and narrow flavors of green apple, lemon and tangerine. A tightlyknit Albariño made for shellfish.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
146445,Spain,"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine.

147078,Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish. Overall this is a perfectly good Albariño, totally competent for quaffing or drinking with fish.",,86,20,Galicia,Albariño

147274,Spain,"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic.

147299,Spain,"Gold in color, with musky aromas that feature hints of butterscotch, ham and spice. Runs more racy in the mouth, with big lemon, orange and passion fruit flavors. Seems a touch unfocused and hefty, but for a bigger-styled wine it has its virtues.",,85,25,Galicia,Albariño
147645,Spain,"Starts with fruit cocktail aromas, which are backed by semisweet orange and lemon flavors. Zesty and clean, with pretty good mouthfeel but not much depth of flavor, complexity or nuance. A good wine on its best day.",Barona,84,20,Galicia,Albariño
147819,Spain,"Tilts the scale on the heavy side. The nose is bolstered by weighty applesauce and petrol yet the palate is surprisingly lean and lemony in terms of flavors. Rather oily, and not endowed with much brightness.",,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
147837,Spain,"Hard and waxy on the nose, with little to no appealing fruit aromas. The palate is loaded with sharp lemon and green apple flavors. Lacks friendliness; healthy in terms of feel but borders on sour.",,82,15,Galicia,Albariño
148026,Spain,"Brass colored, with aromas of apple cider and mineral. Heavy in the mouth with jumpy, tangy fruit and overt acidity. Okay if a bit mealy.",,82,22,Galicia,Albariño
148031,Spain,"Mealy on the nose, with corn and pear syrup making for a less than fresh bouquet. Bland apple and orange flavors are okay but not that stimulating, while the overall take is that it tastes too much like citrus juice and not enough like balanced wine.",,81,20,Galicia,Albariño

104560,Italy,"Crisp and light on its feet, this easy-drinker serves up exotic aromas of ginger backed by raspberry jam, tobacco and strawberry liqueur flavors that show just a bit of persistence.

104860,Italy,"Strikingly crisp, this wine starts out with some woodsy complexity on the nose then adds raspberry and earth flavors in the mouth. A few dusty tannins peek through on the short finish. Try with pepperoni pizza.",Maràia,85,11,Piedmont,Barbera
105000,Italy,"Very ripe, almost jammy, notes of mature raspberry and strawberry appear at first, giving this wine a sunny, full and generous disposition.

106194,Italy,"This Barbera d'Alba from the warm 2005 vintage definitely seems past its prime. The wine is browning and dark with aromas of candied fruit and dried beef. The mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly marked by crisp, spicy freshness.",,82,20,Piedmont,Barbera
106326,US,"This is 100% Barbera, from the Milbrandt Northridge vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. Tight, tart, acidic and vanilla-streaked, it seems at once unripe and over-ripe. Barbera in Washington remains a bit of an experiment.",,85,15,Washington,Barbera

109991,Italy,"Vittoria is one of the best Barbera d'Alba wines you will ever taste.

146142,Italy,"Immediately attractive, with black cherries laced with vanilla and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Similar on the palate, but it turns a bit herbal and astringent on the finish, keeping the score relatively modest for a wine that started off so well.",Costa Bruna,86,20,Piedmont,Barbera
146146,Italy,"Smells like vanilla extract alongside liquid smoke, yet has enough fruit to get by. Flavors of tobacco and cedar are wrapped around a bright core of lemony acids.",La Ladra,86,18,Piedmont,Barbera
146371,Italy,"Cherry, black pepper and vanilla greet you and appear again in the long finish. The hollow middle, however, detracts from an otherwise fine effort.",,84,17,Piedmont,Barbera
146475,US,"Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.",Artist Collection,88,31,California,Barbera
146971,US,"Lots of black cherry fruit, with notes of dry, dusty earth and truffle, and a strong cola element. It's very dry and supple, a wine of character. The fruity flavors are rich, and the tannins are soft and rounded.",,89,14,California,Barbera
147090,US,"Shows an unusually controlled approach to Barbera, with a balanced texture more like a fine Merlot. The blackberry, coffee, leather, grilled meat and slight oak flavors finish rich and complex, and totally dry. Best now and through 2010.",,88,22,California,Barbera
147182,US,"This grape seems to be making something of a comeback, and why not? With its deep, ripe aromas of red berries, stone fruits and tobacco, and soft, generous fruity flavors, it's a good drink.",,88,22,California,Barbera
148452,US,"Smells and tastes cooked by heat, with raisiny, pruny, coffee flavors. Yet there's something likeable about this honest, bone-dry country wine.",,85,25,California,Barbera
148465,US,"Robust, full-bodied and bone dry, with baked cherry pie, black currant and mocha flavors accented by sweet toasty oak, this wine is wrapped in thick, jagged tannins. The best thing about it is the rich, ripe, deeply fruity flavors.",Partridge-Leigh Vineyard,85,25,California,Barbera
148510,US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19,California,Barbera
148819,US,"Tough and gritty in acids and tannins, this wine is okay now with rustic fare, and may benefit from some cellaring. It's stuffed with fruity, berry and spice flavors, and is totally dry.",The Heritage Collection,84,12,California,Barbera
148903,US,"The wine has a very soft entry, with sweet, almost candied strawberry fruit flavors. Then it seems to hit a reductive wall, with flavors of burnt rubber sending a bitter streak through the midpalate and continuing through the finish.",,84,17,Washington,Barbera
150248,US,"What a big, dark, rich wine this is. It's classic California Barbera, dense in tannins and loaded with deep, hearty blackberry and plum flavors, with a touch of sweet raisin in the finish. Drink this rustic wine with robust fare, or after dinner with blue cheese and walnuts.",,85,20,California,Barbera
150734,Italy,"Brisk acidity and a lean but smooth profile characterize this taut, somewhat tart wine.  A very inviting vouquet with cherry, cinnamon, clove, cedar, and tobacco notes sets a pretty stage for the palate, but after the great setup the wine delivers rather uninspired and predictable tart berry and sour cherry Barbera flavors.  The sour plum and earth finish is full but quite dry.",,84,10,Piedmont,Barbera
9083,Portugal,"This wine is made from the Bastardo grape which, as its name suggests, is tough to handle and rarely found. Very light in color and with a rustic flavor, the wine is light with hints of red berry fruits. A curiosity. Drink now.",,86,32,Douro,Bastardo
13360,Portugal,"A very light-colored wine, almost rosé, typical of the Bastardo grape, which has almost disappeared in the Douro. In that sense, this is a curiosity and the farmyard taste says much of why it is rarely found.",Conceito Bastardo,84,30,Duriense,Bastardo
