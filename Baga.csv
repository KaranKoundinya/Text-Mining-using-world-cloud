91,Portugal,"The local Baga grape, better known for producing structured red wines, also lends itself to fruity sparkling rosé. Bright acidity gives this crisp wine its tangy, red currant character. Drink now.",Marquês de Marialva Rosé Bruto,86,12,Beira Atlantico,Baga
521,Portugal,"This is a rich, full-bodied and wood-aged wine, produced from vines in the village of Panasqueira. It has herbal and mint flavors, with black fruit tones powered by structured tannins. It is impressive, ripe, and still maturing. Best after 2016.",Vinha Pan,92,40,Beiras,Baga
5229,Portugal,"Baga, a grape unique to the Bairrada region, has a reputation for producing tough wines when young. This wine, however, shows the potential of aging the variety. Ripe and rich in character, this wine marries powerful blackberry tones with brooding, structured tannins. It could still age further, but the wine is very drinkable now.",Aliança,90,41,Bairrada,Baga
5549,Portugal,"Firm and dense, this is a fine example of the Baga grape. It gives both juicy blackberry and red berry notes, with a solid layer of firm tannins. It has the power, the structure and the acidity to see sometime in the cellar. Drink after 2016.",,89,28,Bairrada,Baga
6355,Portugal,"After five years, the Baga is beginning to soften to create a structured while generously fruity wine. It has acidity and a solid tannic base which is topped by black currant and berry fruits and followed by a richly juicy aftertaste. The crisp, crunchy aftertaste is typical of the grape as it matures. Drink now and until 2022.",Marquês de Marialva,88,9,Bairrada,Baga
15168,Portugal,"Luis Pato's Bairradas used to be the standouts of the D.O. In a sense they still are, although he has chosen to label them with the regional denomination of Beiras in protest over restrictive practices. In this example, Pato has harnessed the rough tannins and brash acidity of Baga into a rich creamy wine filled with blackberries and anise. It's still tannic and crisp, but it just needs another 10 years in the cellar to become fully appreciable.",Quinta do Moinho Baga,91,60,Beiras,Baga
20221,Portugal,"A finely perfumed wine, its ripe fruits given extra style by wood aging. Made from the local Baga, this shows the potential of what can be a tannic grape.

36160,Portugal,"A rich wine, full of dark plums, big and dusty tannins and a powerful core of dryness. The wood aging has brought out mint as well as spice, smoothing the rough edges to give an impressive and elegant finish. Keep for 4–5 years.",Vinhas Velhas de Santa Maria,93,70,Beiras,Baga
36290,Portugal,"Baga can be a shock to the palate because of its tannins. But this wine seems to have fruitiness to offset the intense, dry texture. It shows black currant and herb flavors, which come laden with spice on the finish.",Tinto,88,23,Bairrada,Baga
51529,Portugal,"As the base for a sparkling wine, Baga doesn't lose its tannic character. But it does offer great fruitiness, an apple crispness and tight acidity. A sparkling wine for food.",Quinta do Moinho Rosé Bruto,88,,Vinho Espumante de Qualidade,Baga
65816,Portugal,"Bairrada's difficult grape, the Baga, needs time for aging, which is what has happened here. The result is a wine that is fragrant, not heavy, poised and fresh.

Just ready to drink, but worth aging.",Quinta das Baceladas,92,28,Bairrada,Baga
79116,Portugal,"One of the finest Portuguese winemakers, Luis Pato also likes to portray himself as a rebel against the wine establishment. This wine revels in its pure Baga character, packed with earthy tannins yet also rich in its black currant fruit.",Pato Rebel,89,,Beiras,Baga
