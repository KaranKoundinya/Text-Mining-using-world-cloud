335,Portugal,"The top wine in the Rocim range is produced from selected Alicante Bouschet grapes. It is huge and powerful, perhaps too much in its concentration, richness and density.

995,Portugal,"This is a dry sparkling wine with tannins, spice and berry fruit, giving it a deep color. Not an apéritif wine, it's perfect for cutting through rich, oily foods. Drink now.",Plexus Tinto,85,7,Tejo,Alicante Bouschet
1760,US,"The fact that this variety is still in the ground in the county says something; the fact that's it's still in the confines of Pagani Ranch says even more. In this ode to generations gone by, the grower and winemaker find common ground in showcasing a big-bodied, black-purple expression of fig, plum and grippy leather that lands softly on the palate.",Pagani Ranch,90,36,California,Alicante Bouschet
2991,Portugal,"The red juiced Alicante Bouschet has produced a powerful and generous wine that's rich and full of southern sun as well as dark black fruits.

20608,Portugal,"Hugely black in color, a big-hearted wine that tames the rustic Alicante Bouschet character to produce a densely tannic, spice and damson fruit driven wine.

31923,Portugal,"Wines at 15.5% alcohol suggest too much of everything. This wine is no exception, with its heavily extracted character, bitter chocolate and wood perfumes. It should soften in 2–3 years, but will always be overweight.",São Miguel,84,18,Alentejano,Alicante Bouschet
39219,Portugal,"Firmly tannic, it's based entirely on the rich structure of Alicante Bouschet. It has an interplay of dark fruits, spicy wood-aging and acidity. They are combining well to give a well-structured wine that's ripe and juicy. Drink from 2017.",Premium,90,13,Tejo,Alicante Bouschet

50266,Portugal,"Firm layers of wood give a hard initial impression. There are hints of fruit under this plank-like character, but it will need some time to balance out, if at all.",Terra D'Alter,84,15,Alentejano,Alicante Bouschet
52601,Spain,"Opens with a nice mix of black fruit scents, primarily blackberry. The palate is juicy and healthy, with berry, plum, spice and herbal flavors.

93686,US,"This variety has long been planted in California as a blending grape, often with Zinfandel. On its own, as it is here, it's soft and candied-tasting, with flavors of raspberry and red cherry, set off by brisk acidity and firm tannins in a light-bodied texture.

141726,Australia,"Meant to be served chilled and young, this peppy red has vibrant berry-basket aromas and flavors. It's a fresh, happy wine, very juicy with pure fruit. Goes well with crabcakes, and probably just as well with fiery curries.",,89,,South Australia,Alicante Bouschet
143436,US,"These old vines have yielded an extraordinarily dark, dense wine, the quintessence of black cherry flavors, but weighty with currants. It's extremely dry and pretty tannic, with a puckery grapeskin finish, and should age well.
