370,France,"The nose is like pear juice spilled onto warm earth, while the palate is more citrus-focused. A seam of almost tropical acidity links lemon to notes of pineapple, lifted by joyful freshness.",Zind,90,30,Alsace,Alsace white blend
2734,France,"Lifted notes of dried pear, dried chamomile flowers and dried lemon peel have a strong impact. The palate comes in with lovely generous sweetness that amplifies that chamomile-tisane notion and boosts the dried-fruit notes. Against the distinctly medium-sweet fruitiness stands a clarion line of acidity. The evolution of fruit flavors weaves a colorful tapestry of aromas. This is carefully balanced and quietly intense. It holds immense strength at its core that radiates flavor and fruit. Made from a field blend of Alsace varieties, each adds something: aroma, texture, freshness and body. The finish is endless and very fruity. Have this with cheese or a subtle dessert. Drink now through 2035.",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,95,66,Alsace,Alsace white blend
2736,France,"An incredibly pure and piercing note of lemon oil hits the nose. The medium-sweet palate impresses with both fresh and dried notes of fruit: plum, white sultana, white currant and the ripest pear and apple you can imagine. This is full-on and big but balanced by tingling, fresh and precise acidity. A field blend of polar opposites, Riesling and Gewurztraminer, this unites their virtues of aromatic textured richness and poised finesse. Again, this is not a wine that is easily categorized with its medium-sweet, soil- and fruit-driven profile, but it is a joy to experience and savor. The finish lasts and lasts. Drink 2017–2035.",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,95,50,Alsace,Alsace white blend
3053,France,"The lifted nose seems like an amalgam of chalk and dried apples along with lemon zest. The aromas are reminiscent of evolving Riesling but this is not the only grape in this expressive and highly aromatic field blend. While there is distinct residual sweetness on the palate, this has a counterweight in the rich texture of the midpalate. There is something authentic and deeply comforting and satisfying at the core of this wine that says Alsace. It's impossible to put this wine into a box, it needs to be tasted and enjoyed on its very own terms. The finish is medium sweet, totally soil-driven and very, very long. This is an experience rather than a drink. Drink now through 2035.",Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,95,98,Alsace,Alsace white blend
3303,France,"Enticing aromas of freshly cut Cox Orange Pippin apples reach every corner of this easy, fruity wine. The palate is crisp yet full flavored, light-bodied and dry. The finish is lasting and superclean.",Alsace Dream,89,23,Alsace,Alsace white blend
3309,France,"Ripe notes of juicy yellow-pear waft from the glass The palate is equally full-fruited but comes with a dry, crisp and refreshing palate and a clean finish.",W3,89,15,Alsace,Alsace white blend
3946,France,"Hints of sultana and cooked quince reach the nose suggesting richness. The palate, however, responds with streamlined freshness, ripe fruit and depth and gives us concentration rather than richness. Tangy citrus zest frames notions of ripe apple and quince while shadows of dried fruit still haunt aromatically. The finish is clean, totally satisfying and dry. This is soaring but hearty stuff.",Langenberg,94,34,Alsace,Alsace white blend
4248,France,"Brilliant golden color promises richness. The nose obliges with a seamless scent of apples: fresh and ripe, baked and mellow. The palate shows soaring freshness, but countless notions swirl on the dry palate of this traditional field blend: citrus and apple, pear and blossom. There is so much fruit, so much expression, this is pure exuberance, but in a rather grown-up way. A very apt expression of both the freshness and the richness of Alsace.",Alsace,93,24,Alsace,Alsace white blend
4465,France,"The aroma recalls ripe, juicy pear peel. Likewise, the palate sings with ripe pear notes, framed by a phenolic texture and countered by lively freshness. This wine is brisk, clean and fruity.",Gentil,89,18,Alsace,Alsace white blend
4761,France,"The nose needs air but as it wakes up, subtle notes of fragrant baked peach rise. On the palate a streak of lemon freshness provides both frame and direction, alongside a lovely apple-skin texture. Made from a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer this unites the virtues of each variety. This is full of life and impresses with its great precision and freshness. The finish is bone dry. Lovely now but will age. Drink now through 2025.",Win.ck,93,27,Alsace,Alsace white blend
5113,France,"Slightly muddled pear and earth flavors appear on the nose. The palate is far more defined, with fresh pear notes and distant hints of pineapple. This is dry, full-fruited and fresh.",Côtes d'Ammerschwihr,88,18,Alsace,Alsace white blend
5363,France,"Faint pear notes on the nose lead to a savory, earthy but crisp palate. The finish is very clean, even cleansing. This will shine with food.",,88,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
5930,France,"The nose is shy but subtly hints at citrus zest. The palate comes alive with subtle, fresh and very pure fruit: exquisitely accurate notions of mirabelle plum and beautifully aromatic tangerine. This is pure, streamlined and richly fruited, but done in a subtle grown-up way. A real joy to savor and drink. Finishes dry.",Cuvée 8,92,35,Alsace,Alsace white blend
6064,France,"The nose is shy but subtly hints at citrus zest.

6748,France,Peach and rose-focused potpourri scent the nose. The palate has great direction and freshness and a rich textured core that almost comes across as oily. The result is a perfect contrast between tangy freshness and rich fruit. Bursting fruit and perfume are countered by zesty citrus. The flavors last and last and the finish is dry.,Gentil de Katz,92,18,Alsace,Alsace white blend

The flavors last and last and the finish is dry.,Gentil de Katz,92,18,Alsace,Alsace white blend
7038,France,Soft and spicy honeysuckle notes hover pleasantly. The palate shows the same aromatic overtones and has a sprightly freshness. The finish is dry and lively. Drink soon.,One,87,13,Alsace,Alsace white blend
7555,France,"Earthy notes of pear peel promise texture and the very crisp, bright palate delivers, but with edges of bitterness. The finish is wonderfully brisk. This wine will do so much better with food.",Cuvée 8,87,35,Alsace,Alsace white blend
8162,France,"At one moment there is a whiff of fresh apple, the next a hint of wet earth and orange peel. Brisk and dry, the palate also veers from rounded fruit to earthier, funkier notes. It finishes clean and refreshing.",,87,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
8761,France,"Slightly high-toned hints precede nuances of pear and lemon. The palate is light, dry and crisp, finishing with a fresh, clean lemon note.",Crustacés,86,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
9143,France,"A distinctly aromatic nose tells of honeysuckle while the dry, light palate is sherbety and less defined. Drink this easygoing wine soon, while aromas are fresh.",Grains de Génie,86,14,Alsace,Alsace white blend
11173,France,"Stone, earth and hay are about to merge into notions of lanolin and chamomile: clearly this is a maturing wine at an early point of its evolution. The palate is fluid and has the texture of drenched chalky, stone. The fruit is hiding in the wings, only to appear as orange oil here or as apple scent there. The dryness shows every nuance of this earthy, wine from a historic, co-planed vineyard of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. What a triumph. Drink 2016–2026.",Osterberg Grand Cru Clos du Zahnacker,94,49,Alsace,Alsace white blend
12014,France,"The rosy floral overtones of Muscat are very evident on the fragrant nose. The palate, on the other hand, gives us the texture of Pinot Gris and the freshness of Riesling while floral nuances hover and swirl. This is a lovely blend of all that Alsace does well. Friendly and fresh with a dry finish.",One,90,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
12248,France,"Just a touch of subtle rose gives a hint of fragrance to the nose. The palate is concentrated and almost oily in its texture, there is also freshness. This is a successful blend of Muscat, Auxerrois and sprightly Sylvaner which makes a very versatile and eminently food friendly wine.",Alsace,89,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
13514,France,"Friendly appetizing hints of Golden Delicious apple and pear make for an inviting but subtle nose. The palate is fresh and balanced, with a backbone of gentle but firm texture. The finish is clean and aromatic on this very successful blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris.",Cuvée Méli-Mélo,89,12,Alsace,Alsace white blend
13783,France,"The nose is both supple and rich with its suggestion of ripe pear. The palate exemplifies the freshness of Riesling with its citrus overtones and is grounded by the textural richness of Pinot Gris. This is a rather successful blend of these two varieties, bringing ample freshness, texture and fruit. The finish is clean and dry.",Black Tie,89,15,Alsace,Alsace white blend
17162,France,"A wine packed with noble rot, giving richness rather than sweetness. An intoxicating blend of smokiness and almonds mixes with flavors of citrus zest and toast in this complex, concentrated wine. From the tiny Huebuhl vineyard in Bergheim. Impressive. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Huebuhl,96,47,Alsace,Alsace white blend
17167,France,"The 12-acre Rotenberg vineyard in Wintzenheim produces vibrant, racy wines, like this blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris. It is fresh and intense, with concentrated flavors of sweet white currants. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Rotenberg,95,47,Alsace,Alsace white blend
17317,France,"A fine, poised wine, fresh and vibrant, which just demands to be drunk. Flavors of orange zest and white currants are balanced by layers of tannin and acidity. A delicious wine, packed with flavor. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Schoffweg,92,47,Alsace,Alsace white blend
17332,France,"An intense, sweet wine, this is packed full of orange flavors, citrus fruits and a touch of smokiness. A great wine, it's a delicious mix of fruits and mineral characters from the limestone soil of the Grasberg vineyard. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Grasberg,91,58,Alsace,Alsace white blend
17618,France,"Hints of petrol on the nose open in this rich, intense wine, which has  layers of smoky aromas over flavors of ripe lychees  and smooth tannins. The finish seems to last forever. Imported by Lauber Imports.",Gruenspiel,90,47,Alsace,Alsace white blend
40672,France,"Oxidative and spicy. Effusive mineral notes provide complexity but turn heavy in the mouth without fruit for balance. Crisp, with a silky texture and a short-to-medium finish.",Engelgarten Bergheim,87,40,Alsace,Alsace white blend
42500,France,"Clean and fragrant, this blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewürztraminer exhibits notes of pear and tangerine on the nose, followed by an unctuous, flowery palate that folds into a medium finish of quince and melon rind. A good partner with Asian fusion cuisine. Drink now.",Clos du Zahnacker,86,35,Alsace,Alsace white blend
42502,France,"Here's a spunky little wine, with gardenia and apple scents and a slightly funky background note. It's crisp and medium-bodied, with a short-to-medium finish redolent of fresh lemons. Try with light fish dishes. Drink up.",Pinot D'Alsace,86,26,Alsace,Alsace white blend
44833,France,"An intriguing wine, a blend of Riesling and Pinot Gris, showing developed aromas of char and spice. There's precious little fruit here, though a few apple notes inform the medium-bodied palate. Hay and lanolin flavors on the finish dissipate a bit too quickly.",L'Ame de la Terre Val D'Eleon,85,38,Alsace,Alsace white blend
46029,France,"Simple but with a straightforward grapey charm, this slightly spritzy blend has medium acidity and a short, flowery finish. Good for poolside sipping.",Andante Prestige Gewürztraminer-Muscat,84,10,Alsace,Alsace white blend
55631,France,"From a parcel in the Osterberg Grand Cru vineyard, this is a blend of Riesling, Pinot Gris and Gewurztraminer. The spice dominates although it is cut through by Riesling acidity. It's not quite integrated, showing youthful exuberance that needs to settle down. Drink from 2016.",Clos du Zahnacker,90,,Alsace,Alsace white blend
72377,France,"Labeled Pinot d'Alsace to indicate it's a blend dominated by Pinot Blanc, it's ripe and very fruity with its pear and peach fruit flavors prominent. It has weight, spice, richness and a rounded, full texture. Not a wine for aging, but enjoyable over the next two to three years.",Métiss,87,15,Alsace,Alsace white blend
75307,France,"A classic Alsace dry white wine, this is soft and spicy, with apple and pear fruit and a light layering of citrus. Gentle, very open and friendly, a great apéritif wine.",Edelzwicker,85,15,Alsace,Alsace white blend

148314,France,"Not labeled as late-harvest, but this wine is noticeably sweet, rich and mouthcoating. Honey, baked apple and cinnamon flavors easily glide across the palate, buttressed by just enough acidity to keep it from becoming cloying. Might be best with foie gras or cheese. Drinkable now, but should age effortlessly.",Altenberg de Bergheim Grand Cru,92,95,Alsace,Alsace white blend
148848,France,"Deiss's top wines are blends of different grape varieties that he feel best express their individual terroirs and vintages. The 2002 Schoenenbourg is intensely mineral and citrusy on the nose, verging on quince-like, but turns out to be rather sweet and a bit soft on the palate, where ripe apple and pear flavors are balanced by dry-mineral notes. A slightly bitter edge creeps in on the finish, which dampened my enthusiasm somewhat for this wine.",Schoenenbourg Grand Cru,88,95,Alsace,Alsace white blend
148941,France,"Deiss's 2002 Engelgarten is a firm, dry, minerally wine that ably wraps anise, green apple and citrus fruits in a cloak of austere minerality. Crisp and clean at this stage, but probably needs several years for more interesting complexities to emerge.",Engelgarten,88,39,Alsace,Alsace white blend
149344,France,"A blend of Pinot Gris, Pinot Noir, Pinot Meunier and Pinot Blanc, this wine poses omething of a challenge to the reviewer. The aromas are slightly oxidative, the alcohol levels elevated and yet the wine lacks lushness to balance it's large frame. Instead, hard, crystalline flavors power the palate, leaving the impression of a multifaceted rock. Seems to have stuff worthy of more introspection and intellectual curiosity than our blind-tasting format allows; not a hedonistic bomb by any measure.",Mambourg Grand Cru,86,95,Alsace,Alsace white blend
