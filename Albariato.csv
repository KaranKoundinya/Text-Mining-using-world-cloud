Potent for the variety.",,87,22,Galicia,Albariño
37867,US,"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant.

42160,US,"Albariño is very sensitive to the slightest usage of oak. Although this wine has only a touch of neutral oak, the wood still sticks out.

45709,US,"Kenneth Volk is the Central Coast master of nontraditional California varieties.

46276,Spain,"Minerality and crispness define the bouquet, which brings green apple and citrus aromas.

46448,Spain,"Pure apple and peach aromas are the calling card of a good Albariño, and Pazo de Senorans always has that and a little more. The '08 seems a touch less concentrated and leesy than prior years, but it's still showing all the marine-influenced personality, beauty and elegance of a no-oak, seafood-friendly winner.

47132,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance.

47579,US,"The 11th vintage of Abacela's Albariño is a racy wine, with excellent varietal character. Fruit flavors suggest a mix of cucumber, apple, citrus and melon. There's a trace of oyster shell minerality and a bracing whiff of sea breeze on the finish.",,89,18,Oregon,Albariño
48090,Spain,"Sweet and lightly floral on the nose, but also kind of generic and wan. The palate is wet, with hollow white fruit and apple flavors. There's snap to the finish but not a lot of flavor other than simple citrus. A good quaffer but nothing more than that.",,86,22,Galicia,Albariño
48643,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Verdemar,87,14,Galicia,Albariño

50610,US,"Abacela has single-handedly revolutionized winemaking in southern Oregon, introducing Iberian varieties with great success.

53571,Spain,"With its apple, peach and melon aromas, the bouquet is solid. The palate is a bit spritzy and spread thin, and that's confirmed via fleshy, dilute flavors of white peach and green melon. Plump and simple on the finish; good for salads, shrimp and grilled white meats.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño

56132,Spain,"Mango, citrus and candied white-fruit aromas set up a weighty yet vital palate with melon, apple, citrus and gooseberry flavors. On the finish, mellow flavors of stone fruits and mild acidity create a pure, solid ending. Drink immediately.",,89,19,Galicia,Albariño
56199,Spain,"An Albariño with some body and complexity, Nora's single-vineyard, barrel-aged wine is definitely an oaky one. It has lots of wood dust, vanilla and lemon curd on the nose. The flavor profile is led by apples and cinnamon (from the oak), and it flows well. Not a sticky, overoaked load; instead it has balance and quasi-Burgundian feel.",,89,28,Galicia,Albariño
56290,Spain,"This wine's nose bears an uncanny similarity to animal crackers, and along the way there's peach and melon aromas. The palate is sweet and slightly punchy, with mango and white raisin flavors. Overall, bank on sweetness and liquidy ripeness from this drink-now Albariño.",,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
56303,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
56458,Spain,"Given that this leesy Albariño is pushing eight years in age, it's remarkably healthy. Stony, briny aromas override residual fruit aromas, while the palate remains zesty. Flavors of white grapefruit and nectarine finish citric and solid.  This is a unique style of wine that no other winery in Rías Baixas is making.",Selección de Añada,89,75,Galicia,Albariño
56524,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
56904,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
57392,Spain,"Wet and zesty white wine from Northwest Spain? Sounds good to us. Salneval is from Condes de Albarei, and it offers perfectly proper peach, melon and pastry aromas. The palate is lithe and fresh, with orange and apple. Yes, it's straightforward and common. But it is also clean, balanced and will drink well with all sorts of finger foods, salads and seafood.",Salneval,87,10,Galicia,Albariño
57737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Albariño
58313,Spain,"Slightly more chunky and dusty than lively, with dry apple aromas and not much else. The palate offers a medium level of intensity and flavors of melon, banana and white pepper. Turns drier and more soda-like on the finish. Good but a little short on flavor.",,86,17,Galicia,Albariño
58616,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see. You won't be offended by the wine's green apple and lemon flavors, which are wet, fresh and zesty. But you might like a touch more refinement and dimension. A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
58861,Spain,"Gold in color, with mineral, toast, baked apple and stone-fruit aromas, this Albariño is plump and mature on the palate. Flavors of peach, papaya and minerals finish long and peachy, with baked apple and minerally notes to the finish. This is showing its age; drink immediately or  wait for the 2012.",Selección Finca Monte Alto,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
58869,Spain,"This mature Albariño is mellow on the nose, then wide and melony in feel. It's leesy but also healthy in terms of acidity, with flavors of papaya, melon and peach. It's flavorful for sure, but a touch bland on the finish.",Don Álvaro de Bazán,88,,Galicia,Albariño
58960,Spain,"This is what Albariño is all about! The nose issues a salinic combo of salt water and sea shells along with green banana and melon, while the palate is jumpy, fresh, balanced and intriguing. The flavors of just-ripe bananas and Meyer lemon are true, while the mouthfeel is both smooth and refreshing. Get after this one as soon as you can.",,91,17,Galicia,Albariño
59254,US,"A brilliant white wine, very tart in acidity, with mineral flavors that make your mouth water. The flavors veer toward bright, tart citrus fruits, with suggestions of Chinese five-spice. The grapes were biodynamically farmed, which may partially be why the wine is so pure.",Ca' del Solo Vineyard,89,20,California,Albariño
59564,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28,Galicia,Albariño
59874,Spain,"Now this is Albariño! The nose sings a pretty tune, backed by aromas of white fruits, candle wax and flower blossoms. The mouth is perfectly racy but balanced, with forward apple, mineral and honeyed flavors. Get at this as soon as possible to enjoy Albariño's classic crisp, oceanic qualities. You won't be disappointed.",,90,15,Galicia,Albariño
60003,US,"Good for Hendry for going with this Spanish variety. It shows the new trend toward higher acid, drier white wines that appeal for their directness. With its citrus, pepper and flower flavors, it's perfect on its own, or with Asian, Mexican and grilled pork dishes.",Hendry Ranch,88,20,California,Albariño
60405,Spain,"Young and vibrant; it's straightforward Albariño from a good vintage. In the mouth, expect green melon and stone-fruit flavors backed by solid acidity and a bit of fleshy weight. It's comfortable around the edges, and overall it's sure to satisfy fans of this type of crisp, clean white wine.",,89,17,Galicia,Albariño
60515,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35,Galicia,Albariño
60706,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
60737,US,"Bone dry and crisp, this white wine shows flavors of citrus fruits, minerals and white pepper. It's an elegant sipper that will go well with Spanish-style tapas dishes.",,87,16,California,Albariño
61254,Spain,"Nice Albariño, no ifs, ands or buts. The nose is floral and clean, and that's backed by a no-fuss palate of citrus, namely orange and grapefruit. As it holds form from front to back, you know this is a good wine. Will go great with light salads and shellfish. Drink immediately.",,88,12,Galicia,Albariño
61583,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",,88,14,Galicia,Albariño
61802,Spain,"Clean, pure and a touch slight, but fine in terms of minerality and zest. This is nice with lots of melon, lemon verbena and almond notes. It finishes very long and nutty, showing good acidity. Drink as soon as possible for best results.",,88,17,Galicia,Albariño
62086,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits. The acidity is a bit pronounced and scouring, but that only means that the citrus and green apple flavors cut and cleanse. Juicy but modest when it comes to depth of flavor. Drink now.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
62296,Spain,"Light and limpid, with mild almond, palm butter and citrus aromas. This is a basic, clean wine that offers citrus, pineapple and mango flavors. It's a bit sweet and monotone in its delivery, but it doesn't offend and it goes down easy if properly chilled. Imported by Martín Códax USA.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
62332,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
62503,Spain,"Hints of peanut and caramel vie with mineral and acacia blossom for center stage on the nose, while the palate deals nut skins, lime, kiwi and gooseberry. In the end, this is a tangy, streamlined wine that's refreshing. It has some style but it's mostly just racy and lean.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
62504,US,"Even by Albariño standards, this is a particularly dry, acidic wine. It's what you look for, and what you get, in this wine from Bonny Doon's Randall Grahm. From the east side of Salinas Valley, the wine brims with tart lime zest and tangerine fruit, with a pungently peppery edge of nasturtium flower.",Ca' del Solo Vineyard,87,18,California,Albariño
62505,US,"Albariño's natural acidity is amplified in this wine, which comes from one of California's chilliest growing regions and the coolest vintage in years. Consumed on its own, the acidity is so high, it's almost sour. But this is a food wine if ever there was one. With salty tapas, it will be perfect.",Estate,87,24,California,Albariño
62914,Spain,"Full to the tipping point, with sweet aromas of pears and peaches. Is it over done? Maybe a little, but in between the folds of very ripe fruit there's some mineral and citrus pith. Bottom line: the funky blue bottle catches your eye and the wine is fine. But the 2005 cost $15 and this one is going for $28. Can somebody please explain the drastic price hike?",,87,28,Galicia,Albariño
62919,Spain,"Salneval is the so-called baby Albariño from Condes de Albarei, and it's lively and complete. Aromas of honeydew and peach nectar are appropriate and welcoming, while the apple, orange and pineapple flavors are fresh and agile. A wine for salads and seafood.",Salneval,87,10,Galicia,Albariño
63279,Spain,"Melon, honey and white stone-fruit aromas carry the nose, with a touch of sulfuric match stick sneaking in late. The palate deals good lime, citrus and spiced apple, and while the finish is lean and short, it's also clean and scouring. A nice wine for near-term consumption.",,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
63477,Spain,"A heavier, sweeter style with cider-like aromas followed by apple and lime flavors. In the mouth, this is a more citric wine that may go well with shellfish. It's sturdy and zesty, but not that evolved. Tasted twice, with this note reflecting the better of the two bottles.",Esencia Diviña,85,19,Galicia,Albariño
63810,Spain,"Round and sweet, with heavy buttercup and honeyed aromas. This is what we call a candied Albariño; it's loaded up with canned pineapple, melon and mango. The feel is plump and the acid level fairly low. Ripe and ready as it's ever going to be.",,85,13,Galicia,Albariño
64331,Spain,"Sharp and sweaty on the nose, with bulky passion fruit, scallion and citrus flavors. This wine is on its last legs; it's soft, fleshy and starting to lose its final vestiges of freshness. You'll be better off waiting for the 2006, assuming it gets to market soon.",,83,22,Galicia,Albariño
64352,Spain,"Harder and more oily on the nose than desired, with white-fruit aromas that turn sharp. The palate has ample wetness and acidity, but the flavors are somewhat bitter, nutty and oily. It's also mildly bitter on the finish. Something's not quite right here, yet it doesn't seem flawed.",Zios de Lusco,84,19,Galicia,Albariño
64448,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine. It cleanses the mouth with scoury flavors of lychee, lime, nectarine, minerals and peppery nasturtium, with a foresty, resinous quality suggesting pine cone.",Ca' del Solo Estate Vineyard,91,20,California,Albariño
65369,Spain,"With pretty flower blossom aromas mixed with lemon verbena, the nose on this Albariño is very nice. There's body and weight, but balance, too. Melon, citrus and mineral flavors are clean and satisfying, and the acidity is bright and entirely food-ready.",,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
65533,US,"Albariño is turning into my favorite dry white wine. It's what Pinot Gris/Grigio claimed to be, and so often isn't. This one's really dry and acidic, with really minerally citrus flavors. Bring on the salty tapas.",,90,18,California,Albariño
65943,Spain,"Admittedly we are tasting this later than we'd prefer, but for an '07 it is still showing vital signs and attractive aromas of sugared pastry, candied apple and lemon-lime. The palate is mostly fresh, though not as lively as it probably was nine months ago, while the flavors of 7Up and peach are refreshing. Drink immediately or wait until the 2008 arrives.",Dona Rosa,88,25,Galicia,Albariño
65968,Spain,"The “value” label from Condes de Albarei is always a good bet. Oceanic aromas and a spritz of lime make the nose just right, and the lively palate of lemon, melon and banana is charged up. Tight on the finish, with citrus and almond skins, and then a lasting impression of pineapple. Young and raring to go.",Salneval,88,10,Galicia,Albariño
66223,US,"This is a really terrific white wine, from a variety that's fast gaining traction, although few are producing it. More should. It's classically dry and crisp, with mineral-infused flavors of apricots, green apples and spices. So good and complex, and exceptionally versatile at the table.",Estate Grown Produced and Bottled,91,22,California,Albariño
66247,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
66590,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
66736,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now.

67121,US,"Albariño is one of those new white wine varieties that's creating such interest. This wine is dry and crisp and minerally, with honey-infused flavors of citrus fruits, apricots, peaches and wildflowers. It's a great sipper and so versatile with everything from Mexican to Vietnamese.",Terra Alta Vineyard,88,16,California,Albariño
67766,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
67792,US,"I wish this wine were drier because it has polished citrus, floral and mineral flavors and a rich, pronounced acidity. But it's sugary throughout.",Danza Blanca,83,10,California,Albariño
68803,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",,84,23,Galicia,Albariño
68804,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",,84,15,Galicia,Albariño
69242,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Gran Vinum,83,26,Galicia,Albariño
69939,US,"This Albariño is a pretty little wine and refreshingly different. There's subtle white flowers and quince upfront, followed by a light-bodied but intensely perfumed palate. While the mouth is a bit soft, this wine ends with a refreshing kick of acid. Try with light fish dishes.",,83,24,Virginia,Albariño
71232,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be.

Drink now.",,90,24,Galicia,Albariño

71501,Spain,"There's not much difference between this wine and the label's less expensive Brandal. This is a bit richer, with chunky melon aromas and peach melba flavors. But it may suffer a bit from additional ripeness and lower acidity. For best results, get at it fast.",,87,25,Galicia,Albariño
71509,Spain,"A little weighty, with ripe apple and peach aromas. Fairly succulent in the mouth, with apple and citrus flavors that are both sweet and a touch chewy. Some pith on the finish adds complexity and overall you can't knock the wine's character. Drink now.",Brandal,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
71586,Spain,"It's already too late for an '04 Albariño, but this one still has some life and kick in it. The nose has some peanut and lacquer, but overall apple aromas ride high. In the mouth, it shows the oily quality of an aging white along with peach, citrus and nut flavors.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
72313,Spain,"This is fresh on the nose, with peach, green banana and mineral aromas. The palate feels citrusy and racy, with lemon, green apple and gooseberry flavors, while the finish is cleansing and quick. This is lean, sassy and ready to drink.",Covello,86,15,Galicia,Albariño
72372,Spain,"Like with past vintages, prominant pineapple and apple aromas come across pleasantly but with a slightly bitter tinge. The palate is concentrated with green apple and nectarine flavors. The finish falls off and loses some flavor as it moves along.",,87,,Galicia,Albariño
72395,US,"With this bottling, Marimar Estate confirms itself as one of the two best, most consistent producers of Albariño in California, along with Longoria. The wine is brilliant, with brisk acidity, dryness, modest alcohol and complex flavors of citrus fruit and zest, minerals, white tobacco and ripe figs.",Don Miguel Vineyard,92,32,California,Albariño
73009,Spain,"This white smells open and leesy, with melony accents. The palate feels zesty but simple, with dilute, tart flavors of citrus and apple. The finish falls off quickly and ends up tasting bland. Drink now.",Salneval,85,12,Galicia,Albariño
73190,Spain,"For freshness and elegance in an unoaked wine, look no further than this leesy, smooth Albariño that shouts of its coastal origin. Sea notes, apple and peach grace the bouquet, while the plump but zesty palate offers minerally lemon, lime and apple flavors.",O Rosal,91,24,Galicia,Albariño
73320,Spain,"Neutral aromas suggest peach, apple and minerality. Solid, compact and healthy on the palate, with peach and white pepper flavors. Good on the finish but starting to show some maturity; at peak level now so drink immediately or wait for the 2011.",Sobre Lías,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
73566,Spain,"Dusty aromas of apple and vanilla break up fast as the wine shows oxidized notes. The palate feels narrow and lemony, while the flavor profile is one dimensional and settles on lemon and tart apple. On the finish, things turn stalky in flavor and acidic in feel.",,85,17,Galicia,Albariño
73852,US,"Over the years, Longoria has proven itself to be one of the best producers of Albariño in California. The 2012 bottling doesn't disappoint. In its dryness, crisp acidity, sleek flavors and modest alcohol level, it defines the grape variety's possibilities in the Golden State. The wine never saw oak. What you get are savory lemongrass and grapefruit flavors, with hints of honey and nectarines.",,90,23,California,Albariño
74156,US,"One of the fuller-bodied Albariños out there, this bottling, from veteran winemaker Volk, is dense in cream, tangerine, Meyer lemon, hazelnut and spice flavors. It's a complex wine that changes in interesting ways as it warms up in the glass.",Riverbench Vineyard,90,24,California,Albariño
74252,US,"An easy to drink white wine, of a style increasingly popular. It's unoaked, allowing pure citrus, honey and spice flavors to star. Brisk Edna Valley acids and minerals make the mouthfeel lively.",Paragon Vineyard,87,17,California,Albariño
74430,Spain,"This is an ideal summer white. It's light but crisp on the bouquet, with whispy pear, apple and citrus aromas. Freshness reigns on the palate despite there being pulpy citrus flavors. Another wave of citrus carries the clear finish to a precise ending. Delicious white wine.",Abadia de San Campio,90,20,Galicia,Albariño
74705,Spain,"Albariño is a fragile style of white wine and some just don't age well. This is one of those wines; it's slightly past peak maturity, as evidenced by wheaty, yeasty aromas. The palate finishes with a hint of bitter citrus pith.",,85,34,Galicia,Albariño

75097,Spain,"Pazo Señorans generally makes great wine, but this aged Albariño is past its prime. The nose is soft and smells mostly of toffee and vanilla, while the wine has a maderized tint and stalky, geriatric flavors of bland apple and oxidized citrus. This wine should have been drunk five years ago.",Selección de Añada,82,75,Galicia,Albariño
76100,Spain,"This is more than admirable for a 100,000-case, widely available Albariño. Apple, lime and mineral aromas set up a cutting, citrus-driven palate, with crisp, narrow flavors of lemon and green apple. A touch pithy on the finish, which is long and minerally.",,89,12,Galicia,Albariño
76648,Spain,"Nice, clean and vibrant, with a welcoming set of peach, apricot and citrusy aromas. The wine is 100% correct and fresh, with clarity and flavors of apple, peach and green grapes.

76668,Spain,"Textbook Albariño from what's shaping up into one of Galicia's best years in a long time.

78395,Spain,"Crisp and minerally up front, with aromas of apple, peach and dust. It's fresh, maybe a touch basic at its core, with flavors of apple cider, apricot and almond skins.

78662,Spain,"Starts out a little gaseous and sulfuric, but it picks up steam in the mouth, where flavors of apricot, citrus and tropical fruits perform a likeable dance.

80173,Spain,"Fresh smelling, with notes of green melon, apple, honey and minerals. It's more simple than complex, with crisp apple and orange flavors and then a chunky, slightly pithy finish. For under $15 this is good, casual Albariño that won't steer you wrong.",Verdemar,87,14,Galicia,Albariño

81757,US,"A wonderful, amazingly rewarding wine, certainly one of California's best Albariños. If there's any oak at all, it's insignificant.

82047,Spain,"The nose on this Albariño deals tropical fruit and vanilla scents. It feels citrusy, with modest flavors of papaya, peach and white melon. After showing moderate vitality on the palate, the finish softens up and slips into the netherworld. Seems as though it's beginning to fade.",Torre la Moreira,85,18,Galicia,Albariño
82293,Spain,"A bit stalky and corny smelling, this lacks the overall purity that can make Albariño great. It's fresh enough, but standard in feel, with simple melon and peach flavors.

84465,Spain,"This is about as strange and individual as Albariño gets. The nose oozes odd cinnamon and resin aromas, which are abnormal for the variety and the Rías Baixas region. A flavor of spiced apple finishes with the same spice character. Funky is probably the best word to describe this wine.",,82,20,Galicia,Albariño

87590,Spain,"Smells waxy, as if it has slipped past its prime. The palate still sports a beam of bright acidity but there isn't much body or lees to accompany the richness, so the volume is low as a whole. Tastes good, but mostly like citrus and fresh fruit juice.",,87,19,Galicia,Albariño
87636,Spain,"Delicious and ready to drink. The nose brims with lemon peel, minerality, saline and natural vanilla.

Potent for the variety.",,87,22,Galicia,Albariño
90086,Spain,"From the Freixenet group of wineries, Vionta is clean but more neutral than we'd like to see.

A good wine, but a basic one.",,86,18,Galicia,Albariño
90188,Spain,"Barrantes is always a full-bodied Albariño from one of Rias Baixas's warmest subzones. The nose on the '07 is of doughnuts and pastry, with sweet pear kicking in.

108043,Spain,"Stylistically and individually, this is not what this critic is looking for in Albariño. The wine is moderately but noticeably oaked, and seeing that it dates from 2003, it has aged to the point that there's butterscotch and canned-corn aromas reminiscent of warm-climate Chardonnay. Lots of vanilla and butterscotch work the finish, and the acidity seems forced. Not poorly made but not really what Albariño should be.",Granbazán Ambar Limousin,83,35,Galicia,Albariño
108369,Spain,"Bee's wax, roast squash and vanilla are the dominant aromas, and all indicate a fading wine that was borderline overripe to begin with.

108737,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character.

108998,US,"Few winemakers in California understand acidity better than Randall Grahm, and he provides plenty of it in this brilliantly clean, bone-dry wine.

109436,US,"Granted, there haven't been that many, but this is the best California Albariño I've had. A wonderful wine, crisply acidic and deeply flavored.

111085,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19,Galicia,Albariño

Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",,87,16,Galicia,Albariño
113506,Spain,"Round in style, with soft white-fruit and apple blossom aromas. Tastes a touch reduced, as if the lemon, lime and melon flavors had been condensed and amplified. The finish is lively, with citrus and some pithiness. Good but limited.",,85,13,Galicia,Albariño
113963,Spain,"Tropical smelling, with green banana, minerality and firmness to the bouquet. The palate is clean and cleansing, which are two very different things, while the wine tastes of tangy citrus and green melon. Fresh, tropical and uncomplicated. Drink this year.",,88,14,Galicia,Albariño
114365,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",,84,21,Galicia,Albariño
114526,Spain,"More tan in color than the usual light yellow, with true aromas of flower blossoms, lemon and tropical fruits.

Drink now.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
114802,Spain,"A clean, easygoing style of Albariño with salinic aromas along with apple and peach. The palate has a perfectly good feel to it, while the flavors of citrus and peach are a little plump and sweet. Finishes with tropical notes and pithy white grapefruit.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño

115028,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",,91,15,Galicia,Albariño

134963,Spain,"Mature and a little waxy on the nose; this is a plump, fruity, semisoft wine with apple, pineapple and melon flavors. It's round and fairly mild, with plenty of taste, width and drinkability. Drink soon before it softens even further.",El Bino,87,13,Galicia,Albariño
135244,Spain,"Light but generic aromas of white fruits and white flowers give this wine a happy bouquet. The palate is starting to tip toward fading, but if you get at it soon you'll find perfectly nice peach, melon and citrus flavors setting up a soft, easygoing finish.",Terra d'Ouro,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
135427,Spain,"Slightly dusty, spicy and cider-like on the nose, with a tight palate holding nectarine, melon and apple flavors. It's fairly exact in terms of mouthfeel, while the finish is clean and reflects well on the wine. Drink now.",Esencia Diviña,88,23,Galicia,Albariño
135564,Spain,"Cepas Vellas refers to old vines, but what's most noticeable on this wine is the popcorn and cream that characterizes both the nose and mouth. In between the oak-aided folds there's melon, waxy papaya and banana flavors sitting on a plump, cushioned palate. It's a holdover from 2005, so drink it while you have it.",Aquis Celenis Cepas Vellas,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
135605,Spain,"Albariño is not known for its aging potential, and this wine already seems to be on the way out. The nose veers toward apricot and cider, as does the palate. Finishes with a final kick of acidity. Drink soon, or wait for the 2005.",,84,21,Galicia,Albariño
135975,Spain,"Clean and vibrant, with citrus blossom and apple aromas. The palate is a bit neutral in flavor but shows good cut and a cleansing feel along with tastes of spiced apple and white nectarine. Finishes clean and pure. Drink now.",,88,15,Galicia,Albariño
136070,Spain,"Pleasant but a little light on the nose, with candied fruit notes. Flavors of green melon, apple and citrus are standard fare and clean, while the feel is fresh and peachy. A balanced and nice wine, but not overly exciting or precise. Drink now with salad or fish.",,87,18,Galicia,Albariño
136214,Spain,"Soft aromatically, with notes of pear, vanilla and banana. Surprisingly, the palate is short and tart, with sharp citrus and pineapple flavors. Entirely basic and lacking punch. Already seems to be in decline and it's brand new.",Contrapunto,82,13,Galicia,Albariño
136366,Spain,"Interesting blanco from the inland Galician region of Ribeira Sacra. It's Albariño with 15% Godello, and it's ready to drink now. Aromas of pulpy peach and pineapple are nice, while the apple and lime flavors are fairly gentle and flush. Finishes with adequate freshness for an '07, making it a no-qualms type of white wine.",,87,16,Galicia,Albariño
136457,Spain,"Smooth and friendly on the nose, with easy melon and peach aromas that give you confidence in the wine's core character. The palate is nothing special; there's citrus and pineapple before a medium-long finish. Solid but not the most expressive Albariño out there.",Selección,86,25,Galicia,Albariño
137216,Spain,"Opens with peach and apple aromas that are 100% normal, while the palate has a chiseled clarity to it that's crisp and appreciated. A flavor profile of dry apple, citrus and dusty spice is good, and the finish is fresh and lemony. Drink right away.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
138106,Spain,"Aromas of apple, fresh hay, pineapple and natural vanilla draw you in, while the palate is lively and fresh, with citrus, pineapple and pithy lemon flavors. Juicy, clean and zesty on the finish, and chiseled in terms of structure and acidity. Very nice Albariño for the price.",Pionero Maccerato,89,15,Galicia,Albariño
138254,Spain,"So young and simple that one can only describe this as Albariño Nouveau. It's a bouncy, almost spritzy confection with pineapple, green apple and other thin citrus flavors. There's zero body to it, but it is fresh and snappy.",,83,28,Galicia,Albariño
138439,US,"Grown in this cool appellation, this Spanish variety is crisp in acidity and bone dry, a refreshing sipper that shows flavors of citrus zest not unlike a Sauvignon Blanc, but fuller-bodied.",,87,17,California,Albariño
138476,Spain,"Light aromas of melon, apple and pear are just fine, and the mildly chunky palate sporting apple-based flavors is good, as is the pineapple finish. Tasty and simple Albariño, and really not much more to say. Good for the summer into fall.",,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
138858,Spain,"Tired and waxy, with canned fruit aromas and almost no measurable freshness. Tastes both sweet and vegetal. May have been better upon release but now it's flat.",,81,14,Galicia,Albariño
138865,Spain,"Dry, dull papaya and apricot aromas surely don't overwhelm, but they don't foretell the complete lack of fruit on the palate. A faded, insipid white wine. It has no pulse and tastes mealy.",,80,19,Galicia,Albariño
140563,Spain,"Tan in color and smelling fairly oxidized. Aromas of peach pits and blanched almond lack freshness, while the palate veers more toward applesauce than fresh fruit. There's some life left but not enough to make it a recommended wine. Tastes, feels and smells sort of jumbled.",,84,23,Galicia,Albariño
140564,Spain,"Chunky spiced apple and saline aromas get the wine off on so-so footing, and the apple and grapefruit flavors come with weight. Citrus takes over on the finish, but it's kind of pithy. Doesn't seem as fresh as it should be for a brand new '08.",,84,15,Galicia,Albariño
141452,Spain,"Salinic, eggy and simply not that fresh. Maybe it's the wine or maybe it's past its prime, but for Albariño it's not showing much. The palate is soft and flat, with fleshy flavors of muddled apple. And the wine just splats against your palate without delivering any grace or cut.",Gran Vinum,83,26,Galicia,Albariño
141732,Spain,"An Albariño-dominated middleweight with pure and pleasant aromas of pineapple, citrus and slate. Rich, round and defined, with orange, banana and melon flavors. Very much on the money, with curvy acids as opposed to spiky ones.",Condado de Tea,89,22,Galicia,Albariño
141741,Spain,"With its gold luster and strong aromas of fresh-cut wood, you know it's fully oaked. To that end, an overriding resiny scent melds with hints of flowers, melon and butterscotch. The palate kicks up applesauce and spice, while the finish is defined by dry oak and white pepper. Full-bodied and deserving of serious food.",Blanco,88,110,Galicia,Albariño
142613,Spain,"Clean and sweet, with an aromatic touch of cookies and cream. In the mouth, it's more of the standard lemon, apple and mineral that you expect from this Galician white. Finishes easy and nice, but not too crisp.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
142615,Spain,"Loaded with tropical fruit, with ample size to the nose and palate. Tastes more of live-wire citrus than anything else, and the zesty finish definitely hums along at a quick pace. Lasting notes of grapefruit and mineral are typical and welcome.",,87,19,Galicia,Albariño
143081,Spain,"Light and easy, with simple aromas of lemon and wildflowers. Fairly forward and pronounced in terms of fruit; the lemon, pineapple and peach are all right there and lively. Finishes smooth and easy, if maybe a touch watery.",O Deus Dionisos,86,22,Galicia,Albariño
143087,Spain,"A touch prickly and odd at first, with cactus and canned peaches on the nose. More canned, sweet fruit appears on the palate, which is soft and modest from front to finish. Ends with the flavor of pineapple Lifesavers.",,86,19,Galicia,Albariño
143171,Spain,"Big-boned and citrusy, with aromas of oranges and melon. More citrus on the palate mixes with the essence of pear and apple, while the finish is tight and rather long. A bit lacking in depth, but ripe and forward. Satisfyingly simple.",,86,21,Galicia,Albariño
143391,Spain,"Starts off with heavy melon and citrus aromas, which are followed by tangy apple and pineapple flavors. Very zesty, with a certain sharpness that dumbs down any complexity that might be hiding.",,85,17,Galicia,Albariño
143445,Spain,"From the outset, this beauty oozes character. The whole exceeds the parts by a sum of three, as the wine delivers full flavors, complexity and a near Burgundian minerality. This is what great Albariño is about, even if it's from a hot vintage. Spicy yet thumping with guava, banana and citrus. Simply delicious.",Cepas Vellas,92,33,Galicia,Albariño
143703,Spain,"Floral and mildly leesy, with pungent aromas of green apple, citrus and honey. For anyone looking for steely, pure Albariño, the single-vineyard Fillaboa Monte Alto is the ticket. The fruit is crisp and zesty, the acidity just right. And the finish runs a mile long.",Finca Monte Alto,91,27,Galicia,Albariño
144308,Spain,"Plenty of white flowers and tropical-fruit aromas signal that this is special. The palate is full to the brim with pure flavors of melon, nectarine and green herbs, while the finish is exact. Drinking this baby is like taking a trip to the heart of Salnés.",,91,15,Galicia,Albariño
144432,Spain,"Waxy melon and apple aromas are intricate and welcoming, while the melon and citrus flavors are just as they should be. Do Ferreiro is a consistent high-end producer in Rias Baixas and its '05 Albariño is great. It picks up steam as it goes along and will go great with salads and seafood. Drink now.",,90,24,Galicia,Albariño
144607,Spain,"A small portion of the wine went through malolactic fermentation, so it offers a lovely roundness. Features floral aromas backed by pure tangerine and nectarine flavors. Registers more fruity and smooth than mineral, with a perfect finish.",,91,22,Galicia,Albariño
144613,Spain,"A powerful wine with forceful minerality. Still, it's loaded with expressive fruit that falls squarely into the pineapple/mango category. Finishes crisp but precise, with notes of wet stone and lingering nips of green apple and peach.",Dona Rosa,91,17,Galicia,Albariño
144965,Spain,"To date, this year's best value among Spanish white wines is this simple but lovely fruit bomb of an Albariño from the quality-driven Martín Códax cooperative. It literally overflows with peach blossom aromas and melon flavors. Brightly labeled with orange print, it's hard to miss. And you wouldn't want to.",,90,12,Galicia,Albariño
144974,Spain,"Full and robust in its approach. The bouquet is fragrant and expansive, with melon and honey aromas pouring forth with gusto. The flavors are quite delicious, a near-perfect blend of apple, melon and citrus. The word on the street is that 2005 Albariños offer great fruit-to-acid balance. This wine is an example of just that.",,90,18,Galicia,Albariño
144982,Spain,"Our favorite among this winery's 2005s, Ambar offers tight, dry, precise aromas backed by driving flavors of melon, peach and orange-blossom honey. Very much on the spot; an Albariño that you can't go wrong with.",Ambar,90,19,Galicia,Albariño
145048,Spain,"Very nice apple blossom and lightly stony aromas greet you, and the apple and apricot flavors are juicy and ripe. This is an all-fruit wine with just enough acidity and minerality to keep it in shape. Finishes with citrus and melon. Drink now.",,89,24,Galicia,Albariño
145176,Spain,"Ripe like many of the 2003s, but still a perfectly fine Albariño. The nose is clean and peachy, while light citrus, nectarine and apple control the palate. Nothing out of the ordinary: fine body and fresh lime on the finish. good as a first-course white.",,89,,Galicia,Albariño
145261,Spain,"A single-estate Albariño with clean minerality accenting flowery, grassy aromas. In the mouth, it'sforward and finely chiseled, with pure apple, papaya and saline flavors. Not run of the mill, and for that we like it a lot.",Torre La Moreira,90,19,Galicia,Albariño
145577,Spain,"Clean and expressive up front, with floral aromas shaped by doses of grass, apple and pear. Tastes very good, with condensed fruit creating a nice mouthfeel. Very long on the back end.",Val do Sosego,89,,Galicia,Albariño
145583,Spain,"Perfectly crisp and fresh, with touches of tangerine and lemon making it slightly sharp but not the least bit sour. More of a zesty version, with correct acidity, ripeness and balance. Yet another fine match for seafood.",,89,19,Galicia,Albariño
145589,Spain,"La Val is an O Rosal winery but its wines are 100% Albariño. This estate-grown white offers a yellowish tint with pretty aromas of buttercup and apple blossoms. It's fairly light-bodied and exhilarating, with pure flavors of apples, honeydew and citrus. Shows good acidity.",Finca de Arantei,89,20,Galicia,Albariño
145869,Spain,"Zesty as all get out, with a touch of spritz. Full melon, nectarine and green-herb aromas set the stage for apricot, peach and citrus flavors. Hails from Condado do Tea and seems racier than most.",Laxas,89,,Galicia,Albariño
145883,Spain,"Lucid in appearance, with mineral aromas adding complexity to the otherwise clean, floral nose. Very dry in style, with apple and pineapple flavors. So crisp and precise that “honest” is the best way to sum it up.",Abadía de San Campio,89,16,Galicia,Albariño
145884,Spain,"This Albarino exhibits good signs on the nose, where buttercup, white flowers and apple dance together. Stays solid in the mouth, with round apple, pineapple and light spice notes working seamlessly. Long and full late, with style and grace.",,89,22,Galicia,Albariño
145887,Spain,"A single-vineyard wine made from tear must that was extracted during a light pressing. It's smooth and concentrated, with apple, melon, peach and a touch of white-pepper. Shows good acidity and style.",Bágoa do Miño,88,,Galicia,Albariño
145889,Spain,"Displays pretty aromas of flowers and green apples, with bright, round flavors of peach and apple making for a pleasant palate. Offers a touch of sweetness and honey at its core. Very typical of the 2005 vintage.",Verde,88,15,Galicia,Albariño
146105,Spain,"Impeccably clean, with light tropical fruit gracing the bouquet. A wine that's better than the sum of its parts; the palate is lemony fresh and satisfying, while the overall impression is that of elegance and simplicity. Perfectly good but not overly flavorful.",Pazo Piñeiro,88,35,Galicia,Albariño
146169,Spain,"More than 80,000 cases of this wine were made, making it “mass” by local standards. But that doesn't mean it's not a quality white. In fact, everything about it is really good, from the crystalline nose to the ripe palate to the clean, exact finish.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
146183,Spain,"Floral, with buttercup and acacia on the nose. The mouth, however, is a bit more austere and sharp-edged. It delivers steely, bracing acids and narrow flavors of green apple, lemon and tangerine. A tightlyknit Albariño made for shellfish.",,88,16,Galicia,Albariño
146445,Spain,"Starts out flowery and tropical, which is likely a reflection of the 20% Loureira in the wine. The flavor profile is dominated by peach and apple, while the finish runs long due to an infusion of Caino Blanca. A nice wine for those who like tropical fruit flavors.",O Rosal,88,19,Galicia,Albariño
146641,Spain,"Highly mineral, with citrus, apple and peach aromas. A touch mute in its flavor profile but still shows enough forward fruit and restrained sweetness to please. Snappy throughout.",Don Alvaro de Bazán,87,24,Galicia,Albariño
146654,Spain,"Pale yellow in color, with elegant aromas and flavors. To call it light would not be wrong: The wine shows grassy citrus notes but it peters out a bit on the back palate and finish. More subtle and fresh than powerful.",Orballo,87,19,Galicia,Albariño
146661,Spain,"Clean and pure to the nose, with lemon and other sheer citrus fruit aromas. Gets plump in the mouth, but not fat, with melon and orange-driven flavors. Good, full, mouthfilling and solid. Shows nothing out of the ordinary.",,87,17,Galicia,Albariño
146665,Spain,"Lemony gold in color, with mineral-infused apple as the lead aroma. Maybe a bit bigger than average, with some roundness and chunkiness to the palate. Still it's a very good wine, one with additional mineral and citrus on the finish.",,87,20,Galicia,Albariño
146852,Spain,"Ripe yet a bit chunky, probably a reflection of this estate's somewhat inland location. Shows sweet grapefruit and almond flavors, with a touch of pithy bitterness on the finish. This winery is owned by Marqués de Murrieta of Rioja fame.",,87,14,Galicia,Albariño
146866,Spain,"A lower selection of grapes than the winery's superior Dona Rosa results in a fresh wine full of apple, nectarine and minerality. Not particularly complex but goes down nicely. Classic everyday Albariño.",Alba Rosa,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
146869,Spain,"A bit zesty to start, with a touch of mineral on the nose. Flavorwise, we're talking apple, peach and nectarine. A solid wine with good balance and nothing out or the ordinary.",,87,15,Galicia,Albariño
146875,Spain,"Pineapple, melon and mineral on the nose are welcoming aromas. The mouth is nice, with citrus and melon flavors. Plenty of feel and body, and pleasantly wet, meaning it's fresh, properly acidic and refreshing.",,87,27,Galicia,Albariño
147072,Spain,"Mildly sweet but not very exact or dilineated on the nose. Flavors of lime, papaya and apple run toward green, but with good snap and zest the wine makes the grade. Finishes dry and snappy, with medium depth.",,86,15,Galicia,Albariño
147078,Spain,"Fairly mineral on the nose, with tropical fruit aromas rounding out the bouquet. Quite fresh and crisp, yet a bit hollow in the midpalate and on the finish. Overall this is a perfectly good Albariño, totally competent for quaffing or drinking with fish.",,86,20,Galicia,Albariño
147088,Spain,"This good value features peach, apricot and some grapefruit on the nose, and in the rear is a full blast of citrus flavors. Juicy, a bit plump and full on the finish.",Salneval,86,10,Galicia,Albariño
147274,Spain,"Good but a bit less concentrated and pure than most. There's a whiff of sulfur on the nose, and in the mouth the fruit is solid but basic. Apple and melon are the key flavors, while the finish is clean but unspectacular. At 40,000 cases this is a large-production wine by Rías Baixas standards.",,85,,Galicia,Albariño
147299,Spain,"Gold in color, with musky aromas that feature hints of butterscotch, ham and spice. Runs more racy in the mouth, with big lemon, orange and passion fruit flavors. Seems a touch unfocused and hefty, but for a bigger-styled wine it has its virtues.",,85,25,Galicia,Albariño
147645,Spain,"Starts with fruit cocktail aromas, which are backed by semisweet orange and lemon flavors. Zesty and clean, with pretty good mouthfeel but not much depth of flavor, complexity or nuance. A good wine on its best day.",Barona,84,20,Galicia,Albariño
147819,Spain,"Tilts the scale on the heavy side. The nose is bolstered by weighty applesauce and petrol yet the palate is surprisingly lean and lemony in terms of flavors. Rather oily, and not endowed with much brightness.",,83,20,Galicia,Albariño
147837,Spain,"Hard and waxy on the nose, with little to no appealing fruit aromas. The palate is loaded with sharp lemon and green apple flavors. Lacks friendliness; healthy in terms of feel but borders on sour.",,82,15,Galicia,Albariño
148026,Spain,"Brass colored, with aromas of apple cider and mineral. Heavy in the mouth with jumpy, tangy fruit and overt acidity. Okay if a bit mealy.",,82,22,Galicia,Albariño
148031,Spain,"Mealy on the nose, with corn and pear syrup making for a less than fresh bouquet. Bland apple and orange flavors are okay but not that stimulating, while the overall take is that it tastes too much like citrus juice and not enough like balanced wine.",,81,20,Galicia,Albariño
