2211,US,"Aromatic and drinking at its peak, this remains fresh, tart and tangy, with palate-penetrating boysenberry and blueberry fruit. Think Lemberger meets Pinot Noir and you have a sense of it, albeit with a slightly rustic edge.",,88,18,Oregon,Baco Noir
39983,US,"There is a horsey, leathery scent as you first experience this wine. It penetrates into the mouth, a stand-off against the sweet/tart boysenberry fruit. Suspect it will be a love it/hate it type of wine, depending upon your appreciation of leather.",,85,26,Oregon,Baco Noir
43233,US,"While sweet and cheerful on the nose with scents of spiced cherry pie preserves, the palate on this dry, medium-bodied Baco Noir surprises with significant depth and nuance. Rich and ripe with concentrated blackberry and blueberry fruit, musky rose florals lead to a long, sweet biscuit finish.",Casscles Vineyard Reserve,87,20,New York,Baco Noir
43825,US,"Delightful rose and violet perfume mingles with ripe plums and cherries on this lavish Hudson Valley Baco Noir.

Finishes with just a hint of green leaves.",Old Vines Masson Place Vineyard Pulteney Farm,86,22,New York,Baco Noir
44703,US,"Unfiltered and unfined, this wine made from 60-year-old Baco Noir feels significantly fuller in body than the alcohol content belies.

45857,US,"Concentrated black fruit flavors are pleasant but obscured by generous oak treatment and slightly confectionery flavors of cherry vanilla and mocha chocolate. Hints of tree bark and green, vinous flavors peep through cream and vanilla notes on the midpalate.",Field Stone Old Stones and Old Vines,84,30,New York,Baco Noir
46818,US,"Scents of black coffee and ripe black fruit meld with notes of damp, forest soil on this earthy Hudson River Baco Noir. Pleasant, but a whiff of rubber that trails from start to finish detracts.",,83,28,New York,Baco Noir
50270,US,"This rarely seen variety (a hybrid from a cross of a French grape with an indigenous North American one) brings notes of ash, green olive and an assortment of berries. It's medium bodied with a low-alcohol feel and cranberry-like tartness.",,84,28,Oregon,Baco Noir
