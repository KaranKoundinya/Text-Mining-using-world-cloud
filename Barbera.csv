104560,Italy,"Crisp and light on its feet, this easy-drinker serves up exotic aromas of ginger backed by raspberry jam, tobacco and strawberry liqueur flavors that show just a bit of persistence.

104860,Italy,"Strikingly crisp, this wine starts out with some woodsy complexity on the nose then adds raspberry and earth flavors in the mouth. A few dusty tannins peek through on the short finish. Try with pepperoni pizza.",Maràia,85,11,Piedmont,Barbera
105000,Italy,"Very ripe, almost jammy, notes of mature raspberry and strawberry appear at first, giving this wine a sunny, full and generous disposition.

106194,Italy,"This Barbera d'Alba from the warm 2005 vintage definitely seems past its prime. The wine is browning and dark with aromas of candied fruit and dried beef. The mouthfeel, however, is pleasantly marked by crisp, spicy freshness.",,82,20,Piedmont,Barbera
106326,US,"This is 100% Barbera, from the Milbrandt Northridge vineyard in the Wahluke Slope. Tight, tart, acidic and vanilla-streaked, it seems at once unripe and over-ripe. Barbera in Washington remains a bit of an experiment.",,85,15,Washington,Barbera

109991,Italy,"Vittoria is one of the best Barbera d'Alba wines you will ever taste.

146142,Italy,"Immediately attractive, with black cherries laced with vanilla and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Similar on the palate, but it turns a bit herbal and astringent on the finish, keeping the score relatively modest for a wine that started off so well.",Costa Bruna,86,20,Piedmont,Barbera
146146,Italy,"Smells like vanilla extract alongside liquid smoke, yet has enough fruit to get by. Flavors of tobacco and cedar are wrapped around a bright core of lemony acids.",La Ladra,86,18,Piedmont,Barbera
146371,Italy,"Cherry, black pepper and vanilla greet you and appear again in the long finish. The hollow middle, however, detracts from an otherwise fine effort.",,84,17,Piedmont,Barbera
146475,US,"Dark, robust, dry, full bodied, tannic and acidic. That pretty much sums up this old-fashioned, young wine. It's a serious cellar candidate, stuffed with blackberry jam, leather and coffee flavors. Best after 2010 and for years beyond.",Artist Collection,88,31,California,Barbera
146971,US,"Lots of black cherry fruit, with notes of dry, dusty earth and truffle, and a strong cola element. It's very dry and supple, a wine of character. The fruity flavors are rich, and the tannins are soft and rounded.",,89,14,California,Barbera
147090,US,"Shows an unusually controlled approach to Barbera, with a balanced texture more like a fine Merlot. The blackberry, coffee, leather, grilled meat and slight oak flavors finish rich and complex, and totally dry. Best now and through 2010.",,88,22,California,Barbera
147182,US,"This grape seems to be making something of a comeback, and why not? With its deep, ripe aromas of red berries, stone fruits and tobacco, and soft, generous fruity flavors, it's a good drink.",,88,22,California,Barbera
148452,US,"Smells and tastes cooked by heat, with raisiny, pruny, coffee flavors. Yet there's something likeable about this honest, bone-dry country wine.",,85,25,California,Barbera
148465,US,"Robust, full-bodied and bone dry, with baked cherry pie, black currant and mocha flavors accented by sweet toasty oak, this wine is wrapped in thick, jagged tannins. The best thing about it is the rich, ripe, deeply fruity flavors.",Partridge-Leigh Vineyard,85,25,California,Barbera
148510,US,"A good California Barbera, with medium weight, classic tart cherry flavors offset by leather and herb accents, and zingy, almost sharp acidity. Has good body and mouthfeel, and cries out for hearty food like big pasta dishes or cassoulet.",Barelli Creek Vineyard,86,19,California,Barbera
148819,US,"Tough and gritty in acids and tannins, this wine is okay now with rustic fare, and may benefit from some cellaring. It's stuffed with fruity, berry and spice flavors, and is totally dry.",The Heritage Collection,84,12,California,Barbera
148903,US,"The wine has a very soft entry, with sweet, almost candied strawberry fruit flavors. Then it seems to hit a reductive wall, with flavors of burnt rubber sending a bitter streak through the midpalate and continuing through the finish.",,84,17,Washington,Barbera
150248,US,"What a big, dark, rich wine this is. It's classic California Barbera, dense in tannins and loaded with deep, hearty blackberry and plum flavors, with a touch of sweet raisin in the finish. Drink this rustic wine with robust fare, or after dinner with blue cheese and walnuts.",,85,20,California,Barbera
150734,Italy,"Brisk acidity and a lean but smooth profile characterize this taut, somewhat tart wine.  A very inviting vouquet with cherry, cinnamon, clove, cedar, and tobacco notes sets a pretty stage for the palate, but after the great setup the wine delivers rather uninspired and predictable tart berry and sour cherry Barbera flavors.  The sour plum and earth finish is full but quite dry.",,84,10,Piedmont,Barbera
